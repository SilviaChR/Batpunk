     Please note that the arguments ""col"" and 
     ""lty"" of plot.deldir() have had their 
     names changed to ""cmpnt_col"" and ""cmpnt_lty"" 
     respectively, basically to allow ""col"" and 
     and ""lty"" to be passed as ""..."" arguments. 
     Also the ""plotit"" argument of deldir() has 
     been changed to (simply) ""plot"". 
     See the help for plot.deldir() and deldir().
