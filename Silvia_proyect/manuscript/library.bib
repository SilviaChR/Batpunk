abstract = {Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40{\%} of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.},

abstract = {Hybrid speciation is rare in vertebrates, and reproductive isolation arising from hybridization is infrequently demonstrated. Here, we present evidence supporting a hybrid-speciation event involving the genetic admixture of the snow-capped (Lepidothrix nattereri) and opal-crowned (Lepidothrix iris) manakins of the Amazon basin, leading to the formation of the hybrid species, the golden-crowned manakin (Lepidothrix vilasboasi). We used a genome-wide SNP dataset together with analysis of admixture, population structure, and coalescent modeling to demonstrate that the golden-crowned manakin is genetically an admixture of these species and does not represent a hybrid zone but instead formed through ancient genetic admixture. We used spectrophotometry to quantify the coloration of the species-specific male crown patches. Crown patches are highly reflective white (snow-capped manakin) or iridescent whitish-blue to pink (opal-crowned manakin) in parental species but are a much less reflective yellow in the hybrid species. The brilliant coloration of the parental species results from nanostructural organization of the keratin matrix feather barbs of the crown. However, using electron microscopy, we demonstrate that the structural organization of this matrix is different in the two parental species and that the hybrid species is intermediate. The intermediate nature of the crown barbs, resulting from past admixture appears to have rendered a duller structural coloration. To compensate for reduced brightness, selection apparently resulted in extensive thickening of the carotenoid-laden barb cortex, producing the yellow crown coloration. The evolution of this unique crown-color signal likely culminated in premating isolation of the hybrid species from both parental species.},

abstract = {Urbanization typically leads to habitat destruction producing negative effects for native species, but some species may exploit these settings. This concept was investigated in the golden silk spider (Nephila clavipes), a large, formidable spider that commonly inhabits forest edges as well as open spaces in urban environments throughout its vast geographic range. Here, we compared variation of N. clavipes success asmeasured by body size, web size andweb positioning along an urban–rural gradient in southern Florida. Frommorphological measurements collected in the field, urban spiders had 60{\%} longer legs and 35{\%} longer bodies than both park and rural spiders. Furthermore, webs ofurban spiders were considerably larger and constructed significantly further fromthe ground than those ofpark and rural habitats. The combined observations of body size, webmeasurements and promi- nent web placement suggest that N. clavipes are successful exploiters ofurban environments relative to park and rural settings in southern Florida. Although previous research has generally focused on the negative aspects ofurbanization on animal welfare, this study provides evidence suggesting N. clavipes might benefit from these environmental changes.},

abstract = {Models of territorial defence tend to omit two characteristics of many territorial systems: repeated intrusions by the same individual and the learning processes of residents and intruders. Here we present state-dependent, dynamic models of feeding territories, designed to investigate temporal patterns of resident aggression towards intruders that are capable of spatial learning. We compare two types of models: (1) a nomadic intruder model, in which intruders never visit the same territory twice, and (2) a single, repeat intruder model, in which an intruder may repeatedly intrude into a given territory but is less likely to do so after being attacked. These two models produce qualitatively and quantitatively different patterns of aggression by residents. For instance, residents with intruders that may repeatedly intrude have high initial attack rates, regardless of initial probability of intrusion, but their attack rates decline over time. In contrast, residents in the nomadic intruder model do not attack intruders if intrusion rates are moderately high, and their attack rates are constant and high for most of the period of territory tenure. In addition, residents of both nomadic and repeat intruder scenarios stopped attacking intruders for a short period before voluntarily abandoning their feeding territories. The results of our models suggest that repeated intrusions and learning processes have a dramatic effect on territorial defence. {\textcopyright} 2001 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Western Madagascar is subjected to a long, dry winter season which coincides with food scarcity. We investigated the effect of this seasonal variation in food availability on the home ranges of blue-eyed black lemurs (Eulemur flavifrons) in the Sahamalaza-Iles Radama National Park, north-western Madagascar. It was expected that home range would increase and overlap more in the dry season. The study was conducted in an area of dry rainforest from September 2006 to March 2008 with five lemur groups. Animals were located by direct observation and geographical locations recorded to determine the daily path length and the home range sizes of the study groups in the respective seasons. Daily path length and home range size varied significantly between seasons. Daily path length was significantly greater in the dry season (673.4 ± 539.2. m) than in the wet season (423.6 ± 183.2. m). Home ranges overlapped between groups in both seasons, but were significantly larger during the dry season (MCP: 7.5 ± 6.6. ha, 95{\%} Kernel: 8.5 ± 6.6. ha) than in the wet season (MCP: 3.0 ± 1.6. ha, 95{\%} Kernel: 4.1 ± 1.6. ha). There was no clear relationship between home range size and group size in either the dry or the wet season. Seasonal changes in home range area are likely to be a consequence of reduced food availability in the dry season. Compared to other primates, including some lemur species, the home range size of the blue-eyed black lemur is relatively small. {\textcopyright} 2010 Deutsche Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r S{\"{a}}ugetierkunde.},

abstract = {In terrestrial walking organisms, long legs help to decrease the cost of running, allowing animals to step over environmental interstices rather than walking through them. However, long legs can complicate the infiltration of these interstices, which may contain food sources and refugia. Since the number of environmental interstices perceived by an organism (rugosity) increases as it body size decreases (size-grain hypothesis, SGH), natural selection should favor proportionally smaller legs with decreasing body size. Recent work demonstrated that ants fit this hypothesis. We experimentally tested the assumption of the SGH that small ants, which have proportionally smaller legs than larger ants, are more successful in exploring environmental interstices because they can easily penetrate them. We examined the ability of tropical litter ant species with different body sizes to access food baits in 'landscapes' (= plots) with different levels of rugosity and food exposure. In the first experiment, three levels of landscape rugosity were defined by manipulating the density of leaf litter placed on the ground plots: a) plain landscape: no litter fall, b) intermediate rugosity (∼ 0.5 kg of litter fall) and c) high rugosity (∼ 1 kg). In a second experiment, food baits were in plain landscapes, exposed or covered by leaf litter. The body lengths of ants that first accessed food baits ranged from 1.5 to 12 mm. Ants that first reached food baits in the most rugose landscapes were ∼ 40{\%} smaller than ants that first found baits in plain landscapes. Smaller ants were also the first to access covered food. The application of a phylogenetic comparative method suggested the same patterns. We conclude that these results support the size grain hypothesis. Environmental rugosity might have operated as a selective force to shape the morphological characteristics of litter ant species.},

abstract = {The IUCN provides a spatial database for many species, including terrestrial mammals. This database includes shapefiles with taxonomic information and the extent of occurrence for each species, and has been used in hundreds of studies in ecology, biogeography and conservation. Here we provide updated distribution maps that comprise the extent of occurrence of the neotropical bat species in the superfamily Noctilionoidea (Mammalia: Chiroptera) after a thorough research of new records published between January 2008 and March 2018. The main motivation for this update was the inclusion of spatial and climatic variables in explaining the ecological and taxonomic diversity of noctilionoid bats. The core of the superfamily (246 species distributed in five families out of 250 species) occurs in the Neotropics and shows ecological diversity unparalleled among mammals. This clade also shows the only evolutionary shift towards higher speciation rates within the order Chiroptera. Updating the range maps for these bats resulted in the modification of maps of 94 species, and the creation of new maps for 37 species missing from the IUCN database. From the 94 modified maps, 55 species increased their latitudinal range and 38 increased their longitudinal range. These modifications did not change the overall extent of occurrence of the clade. Altogether, modified and new maps represent 53{\%} of Noctilionoidea. No copyright or proprietary restrictions are associated with the use of this data set other than citation of this Data Paper.},

abstract = {Despite the routine nature of estimating overlapping space use in ecological research, to date no formal inferential framework for home range overlap has been available to ecologists. Part of this issue is due to the inherent difficulty of comparing the estimated home ranges that underpin overlap across individuals, studies, sites, species, and times. As overlap is calculated conditionally on a pair of home range estimates, biases in these estimates will propagate into biases in overlap estimates. Further compounding the issue of comparability in home range estimators is the historical lack of confidence intervals on overlap estimates. This means that it is not currently possible to determine if a set of overlap values is statistically different from one another. As a solution, we develop the first rigorous inferential framework for home range overlap. Our framework is based on the autocorrelated-Kernel density estimation (AKDE) family of home range estimators, which correct for biases due to autocorrelation, small effective sample size, and irregular sampling in time. Collectively, these advances allow AKDE estimates to validly be compared even when sampling strategies differ. We then couple the AKDE estimates with a novel bias-corrected Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC) to quantify overlap. Finally, we propagate uncertainty in the AKDE estimates through to overlap and thus are able to put confidence intervals on the BC point estimate. Using simulated data, we demonstrate how our inferential framework provides accurate overlap estimates, and reasonable coverage of the true overlap, even at small sample sizes. When applied to empirical data, we found that building an interaction network for Mongolian gazelles Procapra gutturosa based on all possible ties, vs. only those ties with statistical support, substantially influenced the network's properties and any potential biological inferences derived from it. Our inferential framework permits researchers to calculate overlap estimates that can validly be compared across studies, sites, species, and times, and test whether observed differences are statistically meaningful. This method is available via the R package ctmm.},

We present a comparative study that uses data from the literature on the diet and morphological specialization of European and North American bat species to investigate the effect of specialization on extinction risk. We focused on bats because many species are endangered and their high ecological diversity makes them a good model system for our purpose. After correcting for phylogenetic inertia, we compared the influence of dietary niche breadth as a measure of food specialization and of wing morphology as a measure of foraging strategy, habitat adaptation, and migratory ability on the vulnerability of 35 insectivorous bat species. Our results do not support the hypothesis that a narrow dietary niche breadth is related to high extinction risk. Instead they suggest that habitat specialization, which is reflected in wing morphology, influences the extinction risk of bats. Our study shows that an initial risk assessment in temperate-zone bats could be based on data of wing morphology but not on dietary data obtained from fecal analyses.},

abstract = {Cape fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus) pups spend the first weeks of life exclusively or mainly ashore. They are exposed to intense solar radiation and high temperatures for long time periods, which results in temperatures up to at least 80°C on their black natal coat. To test the hypothesis that the natal coat has a crucial function in coping with these extreme conditions, we investigated the insulating properties of the natal coat in six captive newborn Cape fur seals during the first 50 days after birth. The natal fur differs from the adult fur not only in colour, but also in density, structure, and water repellence. We measured temperature on the fur surface and within the fur, as well as skin and rectal temperature under varying environmental conditions, comparable to the species' habitat. Experiments were designed to not influence the spontaneous behaviour of the pups. Rectal temperature was constant as long as the pups stayed dry, even during long-lasting intense solar radiation for up to 3 h. Skin temperature remained close to rectal temperature as long as the fur was dry, while with wet fur, skin temperature was significantly reduced as well. Our results show that the natal coat provides an effective insulation against overheating. The severely reduced insulation of wet natal fur against cold supports the assumption that the natal fur is an adaptation to the pups' terrestrial phase of life. {\textcopyright} 2013 Erdsack et al.},

abstract = {Multiple approaches exist to model patterns of space use across species, among them resource selection analysis, statistical home range modelling, and mechanistic movement modelling. Mechanistic home-range models combine the benefits of these approaches, describing emergent territorial patterns based on fine-scale individual- or group-movement rules and incorporating interactions with neighbours and the environment. These models have not, to date, been extended to dynamic contexts. Using mechanistic home-range models, we explore meerkat (Suricata suricatta) territorial patterns, considering scent marking, direct group interactions, and habitat selection. We also extend the models to accommodate dynamic aspects of meerkat territoriality (territory development and territory shift). We fit models, representing multiple working hypotheses, to data from a long-term meerkat study in South Africa, and we compare models using Akaike's and Bayesian information criteria. Our results identify important features of meerkat territorial patterns. Notably, larger groups do not seem to control larger territories, and groups apparently prefer dune edges along a dry riverbed. Our model extensions capture instances in which 1) a newly formed group interacts more strongly with its parent groups over time and 2) a group moves its territory core out of aversive habitat. This extends our mechanistic modelling framework in previously unexplored directions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A recent complete assessment of the conservation status of 5487 mammal species demonstrated that at least one-fifth are at risk of extinction in the wild.We retrospectively identified genuine changes in extinction risk for mammals between 1996 and 2008 to calculate changes in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Index (RLI). Species-level trends in the conservation status of mammalian diversity reveal that extinction risk in large-bodied species is increasing, and that the rate of deterioration has been most accelerated in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. Expanding agriculture and hunting have been the main drivers of increased extinction risk in mammals. Site-based protection and management, legislation, and captivebreeding and reintroduction programmes have led to improvements in 24 species. We contextualize these changes, and explain why both deteriorations and improvements may be under-reported. Although this study highlights where conservation actions are leading to improvements, it fails to account for instances where conservation has prevented further deteriorations in the status of the world's mammals. The continued utility of the RLI is dependent on sustained investment to ensure repeated assessments of mammals over time and to facilitate future calculations of the RLI and measurement against global targets. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

Ion transport across cellular membranes is critical for many biological processes, including pigmentation, but the molecular mechanisms by which it regulates melanin synthesis, storage, and transfer are not understood. In this review we first discuss ion channels and transporters that function at the plasma membrane of melanocytes; in the second part we consider ion transport across the membrane of intracellular organelles, with emphasis on melanosomes. We discuss recently characterized lysosomal and endosomal ion channels and transporters associated with pigmentation phenotypes. We then review the evidence for melanosomal channels and transporters critical for pigmentation, discussing potential molecular mechanisms mediating their function. The studies investigating ion transport in pigmentation physiology open new avenues for future research and could reveal novel molecular mechanisms underlying melanogenesis.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, Society for Conservation Biology.Understanding causes and consequences of ecological specialization is of major concern in conservation. Specialist species are particularly vulnerable to human activities. If their food or habitats are depleted or lost, they may not be able to exploit alternative resources, and population losses may result. We examined International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List bat data and the number of roosts used per species (accounting for phylogenetic independence) to determine whether roost specialization is correlated with extinction risk. We found a significant correlation between the IUCN Red List category and the number of roost types used. Species that use fewer roost types had a higher risk of extinction. We found that caves and similar structures were the most widely used roost types, particularly by species under some level of risk of extinction. Many critically endangered, endangered, or vulnerable species used natural roosts exclusively, whereas less threatened species used natural and human-made roosts. Our results suggest that roost loss, particularly in species that rely on a single roost type, may be linked to extinction risk. Our focus on a single life history trait prevented us from determining how important this variable is for extinction risk relative to other variables, but we have taken a first step toward prioritizing conservation actions. Our results also suggest that roost specialization may exacerbate population declines due to other risk factors, such as hunting pressure or habitat loss, and thus that management actions to preserve species under risk of extinction should prioritize protection of roosting sites.},

In this paper, we examined how the combination of high habitat availability, low occupancy rate and short longevity of those roosts may affect the pattern of interactions among individuals in the population. We regularly censused a 5.69-ha study area in northeastern Costa Rica and examined patterns of association using mark-recapture data. Thyroptera tricolor formed behaviourally cohesive social groups of mixed sex, ranging in size from four to 14 individuals. Approximately 85{\%} of dyads maintained associations over time periods of up to 100 days, and 40{\%} of dyads maintained longer-term associations of at least 420 days across sex classes. Individuals within social groups did not always roost together, but they shared a small common roosting home range, which averaged just 0.19ha. Members of different social groups rarely associated, although limited associations between members of select social groups in one subunit were observed. However, roosting home ranges of adjacent social groups often overlapped (up to 39{\%} of home ranges, and up to 92{\%} of the area of the smaller home range), and home range centres were situated less than 100m apart. Thus, social groups rarely interacted but overlapped in space. The features of this social system are unique among bats and mammals in general, and point to groupings based on kinship or cooperation. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

abstract = {Animal societies can be organised in multiple hierarchical tiers [1]. Such multilevel societies, where stable groups move together through the landscape, overlapping and associating preferentially with specific other groups, are thought to represent one of the most complex forms of social structure in vertebrates. For example, hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas) live in units consisting of one male and one or several females, or of several solitary males, that group into clans. These clans then come together with solitary bachelor males to form larger bands [2]. This social structure means that individuals have to track many different types of relationships at the same time [1,3]. Here, we provide detailed quantitative evidence for the presence of a multilevel society in a small-brained bird, the vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum). We demonstrate that this species lives in large, multi-male, multi-female groups that associate preferentially with specific other groups, both during the day and at night-time communal roosts.},

The Pigmentary System, Second Edition, gathers into one convenient, all-inclusive volume a wealth of information about the science of pigmentation and all the common and rare clinical disorders that affect skin color. The two parts, physiology (science) and pathophysiology (clinical disorders), are complementary and annotated so that those reading one part can easily refer to relevant sections in the other. For the clinician interested in common or rare pigment disorders or the principles of teaching about such disorders, this book provides an immediate and complete resource on the biologic bases for these disorders. For the scientist studying the biology of melanocyte function, the book provides a list of disorders that are related to basic biological functions of melanocytes. New features of this Second Edition include: Completely new section on the basic science of pigmentation - explaining the integration of melanocyte functions with other epidermal cells and with various organ systems like the immune system. New chapters on pigmentary disorders related to intestinal diseases, the malignant melanocyte, benign proliferations of melanocytes (nevi) and phototherapy with narrow band UV. All clinical chapters include the latest genetic findings and advances in therapy. More than 400 color images of virtually all clinical disorders. The book is ideal for all dermatologists and especially those interested in disorders of pigmentation. It is of particular use for pediatric dermatologists and medical geneticists caring for patients with congenital and genetic pigmentary disorders. This authoritative volume will fill the gap for dermatology training programs that do not have local experts on pigmentation. Basic and cosmetic scientists studying pigmentation and melanocytes will find the science and clinical correlations very useful in showing human significance and relevance to the results of their studies. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Territoriality is thought to lead to increased reproductive success by defending a particular area containing critical resources. I describe several factors that influence territorial aggression in free-ranging striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio), a group-living solitary forager. I induced territorial aggression by attracting mice of different groups using bait either at territory boundaries or in front of nests. Striped mice are territorial and make decisions about whether or not to attack a mouse from another group based upon several factors: (1) the sex of the opponent: males are much more likely to attack strange males than strange females, whereas no sex specific aggression was observed in females; (2) the body size of the opponent: striped mice are much more likely to attack a strange mouse that is lighter than themselves; and (3) the location of encounters: striped mice are much more likely to attack strangers, even those significantly heavier than themselves, in front of the nest than at territory boundaries. These variations in territorial responses between different types of individuals may be due to the different ultimate consequences of territorial aggression for different animals.},

abstract = {Ecological theories of facilitation and nucleation are proposed as a basis for environmental restoration in tropical ecosystems. The main goal of this paper is to present restoration techniques based on the concept of nucleation, in which small nuclei of vegetation are established within a degraded land. The nucleation techniques (artificial shelters for animals, planting of herbaceous shrub life forms, soil and seed bank translocation, seed rain translocation, soil and seed rain translocation's seedling set, artificial perches, planting of native trees in groups, and ecological stepping-stones with functional groups) promote the landscape connectivity on two flows: inward: receiver connectivity and outward: donor connectivity. The nuclei development represents an alternative for restoration by prioritizing the natural processes of succession. This methodology appears to take long to generate vegetation corresponding to tropical climates, but is fundamental in the formation of communities capable of acting, in the future, as a new functional nuclei within the current fragmented landscape. This strategy also encourages greater integration between the theories and projects of ecological restoration for the development of human resources and to benefit the restoration practitioner.As teorias ecol{\'{o}}gicas da facilita{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o e nuclea{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o s{\~{a}}o propostas como base para a restaura{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o ambiental de ecossistemas tropicais.

abstract = {Efforts to restore tropical forest in abandoned pasture are likely to be more successful when bird visitation is promoted because birds disperse seeds and eat herbivorous arthropods that damage leaves. Thus, it is critical to understand bird behavior in relation to different restoration strategies. We measured the likelihood of visitation, number of visits, and duration of visits for all birds and for Cherrie's Tanager (Ramphocelus costaricensis), a common seed disperser, in five sizes of forest restoration patches planted with four tree species in southern Costa Rica. We predicted that the largest patches, and the tree species with the greatest canopy cover, would be visited most frequently and have the longest visits because we assumed that these patch types had the greatest food resources and the lowest predation risk. We found that birds were more likely to visit large patches and the tree species with the highest canopy cover (Inga edulis). Birds visited Inga trees more often and stayed in Inga and Erythrina poeppigiana trees for longer periods of time than in other tree species. We found similar results for Cherrie's Tanagers. Thus, we identified two factors, tree species and patch size, which may be manipulated in restoration projects to increase bird visitation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.},

abstract = {A novel approach for selecting high expressing cells out of a general population that had been transfected with a construct encoding cytosolic type 4 glutathione peroxidase (GPx4) is reported. The approach is described for GPx4-null COH-BR1 breast tumor cells and is based on use of a highly specific GPx4 substrate, 7alpha-hydroperoxycholesterol (7alpha-OOH), as a selection agent. Cells recovering from a highly toxic dose of liposomal 7alpha-OOH were found to be substantially more resistant to a second 7alpha-OOH challenge than cells recovering from a less toxic dose, but were much less resistant to t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH) or H2O2. Several clones isolated from the general transfectant population exhibited variable, relatively low GPx4 activities. However, clones from the 7alpha-OOH-selected population exhibited uniformly high GPx4 activities (each approximately 3-fold higher than that of the starting transfectant population) and elevated steady-state mRNA levels. t-BuOOH could also be used for selecting high GPx4-expressing cells, but consistent recovery from toxic doses was more difficult than with 7alpha-OOH. Compared with conventional "hit or miss" cloning procedures, the 7alpha-OOH approach we describe affords a uniform population of high GPx4-activity cells in a relatively rapid manner. This approach should prove valuable for investigators interested in the peroxide regulatory properties of GPx4, in the context of both cytoprotection and redox signaling.},

Little wax was detected on young adults, but dense wax secretion was found mainly on the dorsal abdomen of mature males of Orthetrum albistylum and O. melania, and pruinose wax secretion was identified on the ventral abdomen of mature females of O. albistylum and Sympetrum darwinianum. Comparative transcriptomics demonstrated drastic upregulation of the ELOVL17 gene, a member of the fatty acid elongase gene family, whose expression reflected the distribution of very long-chain methyl ketones. Synthetic 2-pentacosanone, the major component of dragonfly's wax, spontaneously formed light-scattering scale-like fine structures with strong UV reflection, suggesting its potential utility for biomimetics.},

abstract = {A complete explanation of the diversity of animal colour patterns requires an understanding of both the developmental mechanisms generating them and their adaptive value. However, only two previous studies, which involved computer-generated evolving prey, have attempted to make this link. This study examines variation in the camouflage patterns displayed on the flanks of many felids. After controlling for the effects of shared ancestry using a fully resolved molecular phylogeny, this study shows how phenotypes from plausible felid coat pattern generation mechanisms relate to ecology. We found that likelihood of patterning and pattern attributes, such as complexity and irregularity, were related to felids' habitats, arboreality and nocturnality. Our analysis also indicates that disruptive selection is a likely explanation for the prevalence of melanistic forms in Felidae. Furthermore, we show that there is little phylogenetic signal in the visual appearance of felid patterning, indicating that camouflage adapts to ecology over relatively short time scales. Our method could be applied to any taxon with colour patterns that can reasonably be matched to reaction-diffusion and similar models, where the kinetics of the reaction between two or more initially randomly dispersed morphogens determines the outcome of pattern development. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

Se propone el establecimiento de esquemas de pago por estos servicios ambientales (PSA) como un mecanismo prometedor para aumentar la cobertura boscosa y favorecer el manejo sustentable de los recursos naturales en el pa{\'{i}}s. En particular, se discute el establecimiento de mercados enfocados en la conservaci{\'{o}}n del agua potable y la producci{\'{o}}n de energ{\'{i}}a hidroel{\'{e}}ctrica, as{\'{i}} como la prevenci{\'{o}}n de los desastres naturales y se plantea una serie de recomendaciones para los tomadores de decisiones interesados en este tema. Dado que los problemas h{\'{i}}dricos de M{\'{e}}xico son muy serios, se est{\'{a}} tomando conciencia de que estos ya no se pueden ignorar y que se deben, en gran parte, al impacto de los seres humanos sobre la relaci{\'{o}}n agua y bosques y que los servicios ambientales son muy importantes para garantizar el bienestar de las futuras generaciones de mexicanos.},

abstract = {Basic knowledge on the biology and ecology of a species is fundamental for the realistic assessment of its conservation status and for planning effective conservation strategies. The latest assessment of the 21 extant armadillo species (Xenarthra, Dasypodidae) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for its Red List of Threatened Species shows that considerable gaps exist in our knowledge of these Neotropical mammals. Our goal was to analyse the existing literature on armadillos to define thematic and regional research priorities that will eventually benefit their conservation. We categorized 3117 publications on extant armadillos published between 1660 and 2011 according to their research topic, species studied, country and publication language. The number of publications per research topic and the number per species were very variable. The nine best-studied species are classed as Least Concern by the IUCN, while three of the four least-studied species are classed as Data Deficient. At least one field study was done in each range country, but over 80{\%} of field research took place in the USA, Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia. Most research was done in the USA on leprosy in Dasypus novemcinctus. Most ecological research has been focused on four species, and data on the ecology of Data Deficient and Vulnerable taxa are virtually absent. Field research on armadillos should be intensified to broaden conservation-relevant knowledge. Additional studies in the Guianas, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela and Paraguay are urgently needed to assess the conservation status of armadillos in these regions. Future research should focus on ecology, conservation, population genetics, reproduction and threats. Species priorities should include country endemics, such as Dasypus pilosus (Peru), Tolypeutes tricinctus (Brazil) and Dasypus yepesi and Chlamyphorus truncatus (Argentina), as well as other Data Deficient and Vulnerable species, especially Cabassous centralis and Calyptophractus retusus. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Mammal Society and John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Carotenoids are colored compounds produced by plants, fungi, and microorganisms and are required in the diet of most animals for oxidation control or light detection. Pea aphids display a red-green color polymorphism, which influences their susceptibility to natural enemies, and the carotenoid torulene occurs only in red individuals. Unexpectedly, we found that the aphid genome itself encodes multiple enzymes for carotenoid biosynthesis. Phylogenetic analyses show that these aphid genes are derived from fungal genes, which have been integrated into the genome and duplicated. Red individuals have a 30-kilobase region, encoding a single carotenoid desaturase that is absent from green individuals. A mutation causing an amino acid replacement in this desaturase results in loss of torulene and of red body color. Thus, aphids are animals that make their own carotenoids.

abstract = {We examined home range behavior of female feral pigs (Sus scrofa) in a heavily hunted population on Fort Benning Military Reservation in west-central Georgia, USA. We used Global Positioning System location data from 24 individuals representing 18 sounders (i. e., F social groups) combined with mark-recapture and camera-trap data to evaluate evidence of territorial behavior at the individual and sounder levels. Through a manipulative experiment, we examined evidence for an inverse relationship between population density and home range size that would be expected for territorial animals. Pigs from the same sounder had extensive home range overlap and did not have exclusive core areas. Sounders had nearly exclusive home ranges and had completely exclusive core areas, suggesting that female feral pigs on Fort Benning were territorial at the sounder level but not at the individual level. Lethal removal maintained stable densities of pigs in our treatment area, whereas density increased in our control area; territory size in the 2 areas was weakly and inversely related to density of pigs. Territorial behavior in feral pigs could influence population density by limiting access to reproductive space. Removal strategies that 1) match distribution of removal efforts to distribution of territories, 2) remove entire sounders instead of individuals, and 3) focus efforts where high-quality food resources strongly influence territorial behaviors may be best for long-term control of feral pigs.

abstract = {To test the generality of adaptive explanations for coat coloration in even-toed ungulates, we examined the literature for hypotheses that have been proposed for color patterns exhibited by this taxon, and we derived a series of predictions from each hypothesis. Next, we collected information on the color, behavioral, and ecological characteristics of 200 species of even-toed ungulates and coded this in binary format. We then applied chi-square or Fisher's Exact probability tests that pitted presence of a color trait against presence of an ecological or behavioral variable for cervids, bovids, and all artiodactyls. Finally, we reanalyzed the data by using concentrated-changes tests and a composite molecular and taxonomic phylogeny. Hinging our findings on whether associations persisted after controlling for shared ancestry, we found strong support for hypotheses suggesting even-toed ungulates turn lighter in winter to aid in concealment or perhaps thermoregulation, striped coats in adults and spotted pelage in young act as camouflage, side bands and dark faces assist in communication, and dark pelage coloration is most common in species living in the tropics (Gloger's rule). Whereas white faces, dark legs, white legs, dark tails, and white tails did not appear to assist in communication alone, legs and tails that were either dark or white (i.e., conspicuous) did seem to be linked with communication. There was moderate support for hypotheses that countershading aids concealment, that white faces are a thermoregulatory device, and that white rumps are used in intraspecific communication. There was weak support for spots in adults and stripes in young providing camouflage and for dark leg markings being a form of disruptive coloration. We found little or no evidence that overall coat color serves as background matching, that side bands are disruptive coloration devices, or that white rumps help in thermoregulation. Concealment appears the principal force driving the evolution of coloration in ungulates with communication, and then thermoregulation, playing less of a role.},

abstract = {viable offspring in a bottle was a consequence of an interspecific mating. After 6 days in the bottles, females were placed singly into vials, which were scored for larval activity after another 6 days. Only 2 of the 480 fertile females in the experiment produced viable offspring ; one in a field allopatric population (Forster) and one in a field sympatric population (Eungella). This frequency of hybridization is about four times greater than that achieved with single heterotypic pairs (13). 22. Single 1-day-old D. serrata males were placed in bottles with either 20 1-day-old virgin D. serrata females (con-trols) or 20 1-day-old D. serrata females and 20 1-day-old sterilized D. birchii females and males (experimental sympatry). Five replicate bottles of each treatment were set up for each of the six geographic populations. After 2 days in the bottle, females were placed singly in vials, and after another 6 days were scored for larval activity, indicating the number of D. serrata females that had been inseminated in the 2-day period. The mean proportion of D. serrata females inseminated for each population was analysed in a split-plot ANOVA (20). 23. Invading exotic plants are thought to succeed primarily because they have escaped their natural enemies, not because of novel interactions with their new neighbors. However, we find that Centaurea diffusa, a noxious weed in North America, has much stronger negative effects on grass species from North America than on closely related grass species from communities to which Centaurea is native. Centaurea's advantage against North American species appears to be due to differences in the effects of its root exudates and how these root exudates affect competition for resources. Our results may help to explain why some exotic species so successfully invade natural plant communities. Exotic plants threaten the integrity of agricultural and natural systems throughout the world. Many invasive species are not dominant competitors in their natural systems, but competitively eradicate their new neighbors. One leading theory for the exceptional success of inva-sive plants is that they have escaped the natural enemies that hold them in check, freeing them to utilize their full competitive potential. This perspective provides the theoretical framework for the widespread practice of introducing natural enemies as biological controls, which also are exotic, to suppress invasive plants (1). Plant communities are widely thought to be "individ-ualistic," composed primarily of species that have similar adaptations to a particular physical environment (2, 3). With few exceptions (4-7), plant communities are not thought to consist of coevolved species, nor to possess stable properties determined by plant-plant interactions. Here, we argue that some invasive plants may succeed because they bring novel mechanisms of interaction to natural plant communities. We compared the competitive effects of an invasive Eurasian forb, Centaurea diffusa (dif-fuse knapweed), on three bunchgrass species that coexist with C. diffusa in Eurasia with the effects of C. diffusa on three bunchgrass species from North America that have similar morphologies and sizes, each of which is closely related to one of the Eurasian grass species. Seeds of C. diffusa, Festuca ovina, Koeleria laerssenii, and Agropyron cristatum were collected within an area of several hectares in the southern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains in the Republic of Georgia. Seeds of F. idahoensis, K. cristata, and Pseudoroegneria spicata were collected from grasslands in the northern Rocky Mountains in Montana. Until recently, Pseudoroegneria was included in the genus Agropyron. Each of the grass species made up more than 10{\%} of the total cover at its respective site. At the study site in the Caucasus, the cover of C. diffusa was less than 1{\%}, whereas at the Montana site, the cover of C. maculosa (which is closely related to C. diffusa) was 10 to 90{\%}. Each of the seven species was planted alone and in all pairwise grass-Centaurea combinations. All combinations were grown in sand and mixed with activated carbon (8, 9). Centaurea diffusa had much stronger negative effects on North American species than it had on Eurasian species. When grown with Centaurea, the biomass of North American grasses decreased 85.7 0.3{\%}; whereas in Eurasian species, biomass decreased by only 50.0 4.7{\%} (Fig. 1) (10). Correspondingly, none of the North American grass species (nor all species analyzed collectively) had a significant competitive effect on the biomass of C. diffusa, but the Eurasian species K. laerssenii, and all Eurasian species analyzed collectively, significantly reduced C. diffusa biomass (Fig. 2) (11). Centaurea diffusa had no effect on the amount of 32 P acquired by Eurasian grass species (12), but significantly reduced 32 P uptake of all North American species (Fig. 3) (13). Correspondingly, North American grasses had no competitive effects on 32 P uptake of C. diffusa, but all Eurasian species demonstrated strong negative effects on the amount of 32 P acquired by C. diffusa (Fig. 4) (14). Activated carbon was added to ameliorate chemical effects (8), and it had contrasting effects on the interactions between C. diffusa and grass species from the different continents. The biomass of two North American species, F. idahoensis and P. spicata, when grown with C. diffusa, increased significantly in soil mixed with activated carbon; the overall effect of car},

abstract = {The distribution of resources should influence mate availability and the costs and benefits of pursuing different mating strategies. Where resources are dispersed, males may be constrained in the extent to which they can monopolize more than 1 partner, resulting in social and genetic monogamy. There is abundant correlational evidence that resource distribution influences social and mating sys- tems, but experiments that demonstrate a causal link between these variables are relatively rare. Here, we used a replicated experi- ment involving 160 animals to examine how the distribution of a key resource, crevice sites used as nesting habitat, shapes social and mating behavior of a family living lizard, Liopholis whitii. The distribution of crevice sites had significant effects on several important aspects of the social and mating system. When habitat was aggregated, adults had larger home ranges and overlapped with more indi- viduals of the opposite sex, resulting in increased opportunity for social polygyny. Aggressive female territoriality appears to impose upper limits on opportunities for polygyny by restricting female–female home range overlap. Despite this, males in aggregated habitats still formed polygynous social groups more often than males in dispersed habitat. Aggregated habitat also increased the opportunity for sexual selection, resulting in greater variance in male reproductive success and a steeper Bateman gradient compared with males occupying dispersed habitat. These effects were independent of the increase in social polygyny. Overall, our study is consistent with the hypothesis that habitat structure is fundamentally important to the evolution of social and mating systems.},

abstract = {The limited availability of refuges may represent an important factor promoting the evolution of sociality, particularly in bats. Spix's disc-winged bats (. Thyroptera tricolor) show highly specialized morphological adaptations that enable individuals to roost inside furled musoid leaves. This roosting ecology presents major challenges, as leaves rapidly unfurl, forcing bats to locate new roosts on a daily basis. Despite the reliance of T. tricolor on such ephemeral roosting resources, bats form stable group associations. This social stability has been attributed to the potential benefits that group members gain from searching for new roosts together versus alone. The purpose of our study was to characterize the behavioural patterns associated with assessing roosts and any accompanying communication strategies of Spix's disc-winged bat. We determined that bats regularly monitor furled leaves within their roosting range, during which they emit a number of distinct social calls. Roost assessment involved close inspection of leaf dimensions and surroundings, and was mostly performed by single individuals. Thyroptera tricolor's call repertoire during flight indicates that group contact involves a combination of acoustic signals. Our approach in a natural setting provides valuable insight into the role of shelter stability in the evolution of the T. tricolor social system.},

abstract = {The ecological constraints hypothesis states that as group size increases, groups travel further and occupy larger home ranges in order to meet basic energetic needs for survival and reproduction. In this paper we used 19 years of demographic and ranging data on a study population of golden lion tamarins, Leontopithecus rosalia, to examine this hypothesis. Significant variation in rate of predation on lion tamarins during the study affected group size, membership and population density, which allowed us to test for predicted correlations between these changes and home range size. We found that predation-mediated changes in group composition and population density explained 71{\%} of variation in home range size. Increased predation decreased lion tamarin home ranges because of the effects of decreased group size, fewer adult natal males and fewer reproductive females in the group. The effect of these factors on decreased ranging was offset somewhat by lower population density during high predation, which resulted in range expansion due to reduced pressure from neighbouring groups. We also found that groups with high future reproductive potential (i.e. with multiple breeding females) increased their range size. This effect was independent of group size. We propose a new hypothesis, that taxa with high rates of reproduction, such as lion tamarins, will increase home range size to accommodate future energy needs, rather than current needs, as would be predicted by the ecological constraints hypothesis. No or low production of infants and litters on the smallest lion tamarin ranges in our study supports this new hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {We reviewed empirical data and hypotheses derived from demographic, optimal foraging, life-history, community, and biogeographic theory for predicting the sensitivity of species to habitat fragmentation. We found 12 traits or trait groups that have been suggested as predictors of species sensitivity: population size; population fluctuation and storage effect; dispersal power; reproductive potential; annual survival; sociality; body size; trophic position; ecological specialisation, microhabitat and matrix use; disturbance and competition sensitive traits; rarity; and biogeographic position. For each trait we discuss the theoretical justification for its sensitivity to fragmentation and empirical evidence for and against the suitability of the trait as a predictor of fragmentation sensitivity. Where relevant, we also discuss experimental design problems for testing the underlying hypotheses. There is good empirical support for 6 of the 12 traits as sensitivity predictors: population size; population fluctuation and storage effects; traits associated with competitive ability and disturbance sensitivity in plants; micro-habitat specialisation and matrix use; rarity in the form of low abundance within a habitat; and relative biogeographic position. Few clear patterns emerge for the remaining traits from empirical studies if examined in isolation. Consequently, interactions of species traits and environmental conditions must be considered if we want to be able to predict species sensitivity to fragmentation. We develop a classification of fragmentation sensitivity based on specific trait combinations and discuss the implications of the results for ecological theory.},

abstract = {Social calls in bats have many functions, including mate attraction and maintaining contact during flight. Research suggests that social calls may also be used to transfer information about roosts, but no studies have yet demonstrated that calls are used to actively attract conspecifics to roosting locations. We document the social calls used by Spix's disc-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor) to actively recruit group members to roosts. In acoustic trials, we recorded two sets of calls; one from flying individuals termed 'inquiry calls', and another from roosting bats termed 'response calls'. Inquiry calls were emitted by flying bats immediately upon release, and quickly (i.e. 178 ms) elicited production of response calls from roosting individuals. Most flying bats entered the roost when roosting individuals responded, while few bats entered the roost in the absence of a response. We argue that information transfer concerning roost location may facilitate sociality in T. tricolor, given the ephemeral nature of roosting structures used by this species. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Among the fossils of hitherto unknown mammals that Darwin collected in South America between 1832 and 1833 during the Beagle expedition [1] were examples of the large, heavily armored herbivores later known as glyptodonts. Ever since, glyptodonts have fascinated evolutionary biologists because of their remarkable skeletal adaptations and seemingly isolated phylogenetic position even within their natural group, the cingulate xenarthrans (armadillos and their allies [2]). In possessing a carapace comprised of fused osteoderms, the glyptodonts were clearly related to other cingulates, but their precise phylogenetic position as suggested by morphology remains unresolved [3,4]. To provide a molecular perspective on this issue, we designed sequence-capture baits using in silico reconstructed ancestral sequences and successfully assembled the complete mitochondrial genome of Doedicurus sp., one of the largest glyptodonts. Our phylogenetic reconstructions establish that glyptodonts are in fact deeply nested within the armadillo crown-group, representing a distinct subfamily (Glyptodontinae) within family Chlamyphoridae [5]. Molecular dating suggests that glyptodonts diverged no earlier than around 35 million years ago, in good agreement with their fossil record. Our results highlight the derived nature of the glyptodont morphotype, one aspect of which is a spectacular increase in body size until their extinction at the end of the last ice age.},

A powerful empirical test is to experimentally manipulate sexual selection and then determine how population fitness evolves. Here, we synthesise 459 effect sizes from 65 experimental evolution studies using meta-analysis. We find that sexual selection on males tends to elevate the mean and reduce the variance for many fitness traits, especially in females and in populations evolving under stressful conditions. Sexual selection had weaker effects on direct measures of population fitness such as extinction rate and proportion of viable offspring, relative to traits that are less closely linked to population fitness. Overall, we conclude that the beneficial population-level consequences of sexual selection typically outweigh the harmful ones and that the effects of sexual selection can differ between sexes and environments. We discuss the implications of these results for conservation and evolutionary biology.},

abstract = {The size of an individual's home range is an important feature, influencing reproduction and survival, but it can vary considerably among both populations and individuals. The factors accounting for such variation are still poorly understood, and comprehensive long-term field studies considering various environmental factors that influence home range size are rare. We investigated the effects of seasonality, availability of food, cover, number of direct neighbours and the relative individual body mass on home range sizes in 125 adult female striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, in South Africa from 2004 to 2008. We used radiotelemetry to estimate home range sizes, trapping to determine the number of direct neighbours, and plant surveys in every home range to determine availability of food and cover. Home ranges were smaller when food quantity was high, many territorial neighbours were present, females had a relatively small body mass and during the nonbreeding season. We conclude that the availability of food resources and intraspecific competition are the main factors influencing home range size in female striped mice. Females enlarged their home ranges when territorial neighbours were few, and there was a significant positive correlation between home range size and quantity of food plants. This indicates that home range size might not reflect the minimal trade-off between access to resources that allow for a female's survival and lowest cost for defending and foraging in that area. Instead, we propose a hypothesis for future research that female striped mice occupy areas several times larger than needed to improve their fitness by providing resources for future offspring. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Little is known about phylogeography of armadillo species native to southern South America. In this study we describe the phylogeography of the screaming hairy armadillo Chaetophractus vellerosus, discuss previous hypothesis about the origin of its disjunct distribution and propose an alternative one, based on novel information on genetic variability. Variation of partial sequences of mitochondrial DNA Control Region (CR) from 73 individuals from 23 localities were analyzed to carry out a phylogeographic analysis using neutrality tests, mismatch distribution, median-joining (MJ) network and paleontological records. We found 17 polymorphic sites resulting in 15 haplotypes. Two new geographic records that expand known distribution of the species are presented; one of them links the distributions of recently synonimized species C. nationi and C. vellerosus. Screaming hairy armadillo phylogeographic pattern can be addressed as category V of Avise: common widespread linages plus closely related lineages confined to one or a few nearby locales each. The older linages are distributed in the north-central area of the species distribution range in Argentina (i.e. ancestral area of distribution). C. vellerosus seems to be a low vagility species that expanded, and probably is expanding, its distribution range while presents signs of genetic structuring in central areas. To explain the disjunct distribution, a hypothesis of extinction of the species in intermediate areas due to quaternary climatic shift to more humid conditions was proposed. We offer an alternative explanation: long distance colonization, based on null genetic variability, paleontological record and evidence of alternance of cold/arid and temperate/humid climatic periods during the last million years in southern South America.},

However, echolocation tasks related to spatial orientation also differ among bats and are relevant to understanding signal structure. Here, we argue that the evolution of echolocation in bats is characterized by two key innovations: first, the evolution of echolocation for spatial orientation and, second, a later transition for prey acquisition. This conceptual framework calls for a new view on field data from bats orienting and foraging in different types of habitats. According to the ecological constraints in which foraging bats operate, four distinct functional groups or guilds can be defined. Within each group, signal design and echolocation behavior are rather similar.},

abstract = {Pinnipeds vary in adult pelage color and pattern ranging from uniform white to black or brown and from solid coloration to subtle spotted or bold markings. Moreover, pelage color often differs by sex and age with neonates having radically different color and patterning from those of adults. We explored the functional significance of these patterns in 34 species of pinniped using comparative phylogenetic analyses. We found strong evidence to support the hypothesis of background matching on land because species in which adults or pups have white pelage live in Arctic regions and are subject to terrestrial predation. We also found evidence supporting the hypothesis of background matching at sea because spotted species forage in well-lit shallow waters on-shelf and dark pinnipeds forage in deep dark waters off-shelf. Neonates are black for species lacking terrestrial predators on islands or in caves where selection on crypsis is relaxed. Distinctive markings may be used for intraspecific communication. Sexually dichromatic pinnipeds are highly polygynous and copulate on land, suggesting a role for male coloration in contests for access to females. Functional differences in the coloration of pinnipeds and cetaceans reveal differences in underlying selection pressures, in particular those derived from pinnipeds' amphibious lifestyle. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author.},

We tested hypotheses concerning the flocks daily activity and the co-occurrences of species within them. We recorded 75 species, and the species number per flock varied from 4 to 21. Our data suggest that habitat affects the number of flocks but not their species number, and that the activity of flocks is similar throughout the day. In addition, the association of birds in flocks is affected by interspecific facilitation, with some species co-occurrences found more times than expected by chance. We hypothesize that some tanager species could have a role in flock cohesion. We witnessed 2 predator attacks upon flocks, a number of agonistic interactions among flock members, and squirrels following bird flocks. Our results meet some general patterns described for mixed bird flocks.},

Niche differences are evident from non-random spatial distributions along micro-topographic gradients and from a survivorship-growth tradeoff during regeneration. Host-specific pests reduce recruitment near reproductive adults (the Janzen-Connell effect), and, negative density dependence occurs over larger spatial scales among the more abundant species and may regulate their populations. A fourth hypothesis, that suppressed understory plants rarely come into competition with one another, has not been considered before and has profound implications for species coexistence. These hypotheses are mutually compatible. Infrequent competition among suppressed understory plants, niche differences, and Janzen-Connell effects may facilitate the coexistence of the many rare plant species found in tropical forests while negative density dependence regulates the few most successful and abundant species.},

All the papers relate resources and habitat quality to home ranges. Finally, the authors oppose viewing home ranges as the product of measurements and suggest viewing home ranges as the cognitive maps that animals maintain and update.},

abstract = {Spix's disc-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, form small, long-term social groups in which members are loyal to a patch of forest but move on a daily basis between highly ephemeral roosting sites (partly unfurled Heliconia leaves). This species has been shown to exchange social calls that facilitate contact with nearby bats and recruitment to roost sites. During flight, T. tricolor emits 'inquiry' calls that frequently elicit a response from individuals that have already entered a furled leaf. These 'response' calls are then followed by the flying bat entering the occupied leaf roost. In this study, we examined variation in the structure of inquiry and response calls, and assessed whether calls encode information about individual or group identity that would allow for acoustic discrimination to occur. We found that both inquiry and response calls were sufficiently consistent within individuals, and divergent between individuals, to permit separation of individual bats based on call structure. We also found some evidence for group-specific signatures, although these were less defined than differences observed between individuals. While this does not confirm that Spix's disc-winged bats can discriminate between individuals and groups based on call information, our results indicate that both call types have a broad enough parameter space for this to occur. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {While sound is a signal modality widely used by many animals, it is very sus-ceptible to attenuation, hampering effective long-distance communication. A strategy to minimize sound attenuation that has been historically used by humans is to use acoustic horns; to date, no other animal is known to use a similar structure to increase sound intensity. Here, we describe how the use of a roosting structure that resembles an acoustic horn (the tapered tubes that form when new leaves of plants such as Heliconia or Calathea species start to unfurl) increases sound amplification of the incoming and outgoing social calls used by Spix's disc-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor) to locate roosts and group members. Our results indicate that incoming calls are signifi-cantly amplified as a result of sound waves being increasingly compressed as they move into the narrow end of the leaf. Outgoing calls were faintly ampli-fied, probably as a result of increased sound directionality. Both types of call, however, experienced significant sound distortion, which might explain the patterns of signal recognition previously observed in behavioural exper-iments. Our study provides the first evidence of the potential role that a roost can play in facilitating acoustic communication in bats.},

abstract = {Both species and populations within species display variation in spacing patterns, and the number of published reports documenting this variation is increasing rapidly. The potential for instructive comparisons is high, but the comparative approach requires common terminology. Vague or implicit definitions of spacing systems undermine the rigour of comparisons. Papers were reviewed that examined interspecific and intraspecific variation in spacing systems to determine the degree to which definitions currently produce a common terminology. This report describes and classifies the 48 conceptual and operational definitions of territoriality found in the literature. Only 12{\%} of the papers gave an operational definition of territoriality. The single criterion of 'defended area' was used in 50{\%} of the papers, and the other 50{\%} used other definitions which often consisted of multiple criteria. These definitions were variants of three main themes: defended area, exclusive area, and site-specific dominance, and authors used up to three criteria to define territoriality. Conceptual and operational definitions differed because different questions were asked and because of logistical problems, such as collecting the same data on different species or populations. The taxonomic group being studied also seemed to determine which type of definition was chosen. Although defended area was used most often across four classes of vertebrates, researchers studying mammals chose spatial criteria, for example, amount of home range overlap, more often than researchers studying other taxa. Workers pursuing research in this area can enhance their contribution by using clear conceptual and operational definitions of territoriality, making them explicit at the outset. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Interactions may be symmetrical (both species kill each other) or asymmetrical (one species kills the other), and in some interactions adults of one species kill young but not adults of the other. There is a positive significant relationship between the body masses of solitary killer species and body masses of their victim species, and grouping species kill larger victims than solitary species. Interactions and consumption of the victim appear more common when food is scarce or disputed. In response to killers, victim species may alter their use of space, activity patterns, and form groups. Consequences of interspecific killing include population reduction or even extinction, and reduction and enhancement of prey populations, and may therefore have important implications for conservation and management of carnivores and their prey.},

Within the Chilean hotspot the Nahuelbuta Mountain can be found, which is considered as a high biodiversity value area under an intense human pressure. However, there is no information on the degree of transformation of the landscape and the conservation status of its natural forest ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the state of the landscape and the spatiotemporal changes in native forests in Nahuelbuta. Through the use of Landsat imagery acquired for 1986 and 2011, land-cover and use maps were generated. Results revealed a loss of 33{\%} of native forest in 25 years, mainly associated with the conversion to forest plantations. Changes in spatial patterns of land-cover and uses revealed a profound transformation of the study landscape and an advanced fragmentation of native forests. We discuss how these changes threaten the persistence of different endemic species at high risk of extinction. If the current trend of spatial pattern changes continues, it is probable that these species might face an increase in their extinction risk.},

abstract = {Even though social network analysis provides an important tool to characterize and compare societies, no studies have used its analytical applications to characterize patterns of sociality in bats. Here I use social network analysis to characterize and compare patterns of sociality between three populations of the leaf-roosting bat Thyroptera tricolor. Sites differed in the density of furled leaves used by T. tricolor for roosting. Finca had more leaves per hectare (77), followed by Ure{\~{n}}a (58), and Esquinas (7). The time period over which the probability of association is halved based on fitted models was 1,086 days for Finca, 714 days for Ure{\~{n}}a, and 303 days for Esquinas. Finca and Ure{\~{n}}a had very similar network topologies, with several small clusters, high-clustering coefficients, short path lengths, low node betweenness, and high network robustness. Social networks at Esquinas were composed of one large cluster and several small isolated ones. Esquinas also had high-clustering coefficients, but path length and node betweenness were high. Network resilience was lower in Esquinas compared to Finca and Ure{\~{n}}a. These results show that, unlike many other forest-dwelling bats that switch roosts regularly, T. tricolor does not exhibit a typical fission-fusion social system, and that resource availability seems to affect social networks in this bat. In addition, this study highlights the importance of emigrating individuals in maintaining social cohesion, establishing network connectedness, and determining network robustness. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {A number of studies indicate that tropical arthropods should be particularly vulnerable to climate warming. If these predictions are realized, climate warming may have a more profound impact on the functioning and diversity of tropical forests than currently anticipated. Although arthropods comprise over two-thirds of terrestrial species, information on their abundance and extinction rates in tropical habitats is severely limited. Here we analyze data on arthropod and insectivore abundances taken between 1976 and 2012 at two midelevation habitats in Puerto Rico's Luquillo rainforest. During this time, mean maximum temperatures have risen by 2.0 °C. Using the same study area and methods employed by Lister in the 1970s, we discovered that the dry weight biomass of arthropods captured in sweep samples had declined 4 to 8 times, and 30 to 60 times in sticky traps. Analysis of long-term data on canopy arthropods and walking sticks taken as part of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research program revealed sustained declines in abundance over two decades, as well as negative regressions of abundance on mean maximum temperatures. We also document parallel decreases in Luquillo's insectivorous lizards, frogs, and birds. While El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation influences the abundance of forest arthropods, climate warming is the major driver of reductions in arthropod abundance, indirectly precipitating a bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web.},

abstract = {Temperate-zone bats likely feed in an environment with few dangerous nocturnal predators, suggesting a life largely free of the antipredator trade-offs faced by most other animals. Such bats may, however, encounter dangerous diurnal raptors with an early start to their nightly feeding, and thus may face predation-related trade-offs in deciding when to emerge from a daytime roost. Non-predator-related factors could also come into play in this nightly decision. We used an information-theoretic approach to examine which combination of a wide range of variables exerts the greatest influence over emergence times from maternity roosts in a population of Indiana bats, Myotis sodalis, covering a 12-year period. Our competing statistical models were based on two broad environmental influences on emergence times: predators and physical (meteorological and astronomical) variables. The best-performing model included most of the variables associated with antipredator trade-offs, assuming that bats emerging before or near sunset experience a foraging benefit and a substantial risk of predation by diurnal raptors. Accordingly, state-dependent behaviour was apparent, with emergence beginning earlier during the more energetically demanding portion of the reproductive cycle. During lactation (the most demanding period), about 20{\%} of emergence events began before sunset, compared to only 5{\%} during colony formation. Earlier emergence was also associated with high cloud cover (darker conditions), larger roost populations and roosts located deep into the forest. Moonlight at sunset, however, was absent from the best-supported model and had no apparent influence on emergence times. Overall, the emergence behaviour of our species is consistent with a trade-off between energetic needs and predation risk, most likely due to the temporal overlap of early emergences with the activity period of diurnal raptors. This behaviour may be more common than expected in temperate-zone bats.},

Fern patches and logs had five and eight times higher densities of woody recruits, respectively, as grassy areas. They also had more than twice the species richness and growth as grassy areas. Grass apparently presents a competitive barrier against invading woody recruits, and also attracts cattle that may trample and/or consume recruits. Both logs and patches of fern appeared to provide superior conditions for establishment and growth of woody species, and they did not attract cattle.

abstract = {Understanding space use by animals plays a key role in a wide array of behavioural and ecological fields of study. An insight into how and why species use the space available to them may aid their conservation. The West European hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus, a species in decline in part of its range, is relatively mobile and adapted to a wide range of habitat types. However, it is frequently associated with edge habitats. This edge-refuging behaviour is not well understood and may be the result of fear of predators, food availability or other factors. We used radiotelemetry to investigate the movement of hedgehogs in comparable landscapes with high and low predator (badgers, Meles meles) abundance. Simultaneously, food availability was assessed in both landscapes. Our results suggest that agricultural habitats may be ‘landscapes of fear' for hedgehogs in the presence of a high number of predators. On agricultural fields, hedgehogs were on average situated closer to edge cover in areas with predators present. It is thus likely to be beneficial for the conservation of hedgehogs in areas with a high number of predators to increase the complexity of the habitat structure by, among other measures, establishing more and denser hedgerows in rural areas. Our results suggest that enhancing the complexity of the habitat structure might lessen the effects of fear. Additionally, our results emphasize the importance of integrating data on predator abundance and food availability in studies that focus on habitat selection behaviour and species conservation.

A este hecho hay que agregarle las muy variadas obras de ingenier{\'{i}}a que ha desarrollado a lo largo de su historia, como la construcci{\'{o}}n del Canal de Panam{\'{a}} (que comunica el Oc{\'{e}}ano Atl{\'{a}}ntico con el Oc{\'{e}}ano Pac{\'{i}}fico), Canal de Suez (que conecta el Mar Rojo con el Mar Mediterr{\'{a}}neo), el Canal Welland (que une al Oc{\'{e}}ano Atl{\'{a}}ntico con los Grandes Lagos de Norteam{\'{e}}rica), por mencionar algunos, las cuales han permitido el libre paso de especies, traspasando, con mucho, sus l{\'{i}}mites de su distribuci{\'{o}}n natural. Lodge (1993a) menciona que la mayor{\'{i}}a de los pa{\'{i}}ses tienen documentadas entre 10 2-10 4 especies introducidas, el cual es un n{\'{u}}mero muy bajo con respecto al que posiblemente haya de especies introducidas no documentadas. Por si lo anterior no fuera poco, una consecuencia del inter{\'{e}}s del hombre por mejorar su calidad de vida, saciar su curiosidad y tener nuevas distracciones (mascotas y plantas ex{\'{o}}ticas) ha sido la introducci{\'{o}}n de especies animales y vegetales fuera de su {\'{a}}rea natural de distribuci{\'{o}}n, lo cual no siempre ha dado el resultado esperado. Aunado a lo anterior se encuentra el hecho de que muchas introducciones suelen ser accidentales, ya sea porque al introducir la especie deseada se introduzca sin saberlo una especie no deseada. Conceptos Antes de entrar de lleno en la importancia ecol{\'{o}}gica y econ{\'{o}}mica derivada de la introducci{\'{o}}n de especies, es necesario revisar los conceptos m{\'{a}}s relevantes de este tema. El t{\'{e}}rmino especie introducida se refiere a las especies presentes de forma natural en un pa{\'{i}}s distinto al de origen (P{\'{e}}rez-Bote 1994). Las especies translocadas son aquellas especies nativas o introducidas que han sido trasladadas fuera de su {\'{a}}rea natural de distribuci{\'{o}}n, o donde fueron introducidas inicialmente, pero siempre dentro del mismo pa{\'{i}}s (Hodder y Bullock 1997). Mientras que el t{\'{e}}rmino especie ex{\'{o}}tica se refiere a las especies que habitando en cautividad en un determinado pa{\'{i}}s son originarias de otro distinto (Granado-Lorencio 1995). As{\'{i}}, el t{\'{e}}rmino de especies ex{\'{o}}ticas aclimatadas son las que se han adaptado a los nuevos ambientes (Hol{\c{c}}ik 1991). Por el contrario, especie nativa es la que se encuentra de forma natural en un determinado h{\'{a}}bitat (Hodder y Bullock 1997). Establecida es la especie que est{\'{a}} permanentemente en el {\'{a}}rea donde se introdujo o transloc{\'{o}} (Hol{\c{c}}ik 1991). Sin embargo, una especie posiblemente establecida es la especie cuya eliminaci{\'{o}}n ser{\'{i}}a pr{\'{a}}cticamente impracticable (Granado-Lorencio 1995). Las especies naturalizadas son las que explotan los recursos antes no explotados por la fauna nativa, Biolog{\'{i}}a Informa (1999)},

abstract = {Color loci in mammals are those genetic loci in which mutations can affect pigmentation of the hair, skin, and/or eyes. In the mouse, over 800 phenotypic alleles are now known, at 127 identified color loci. As the number of color loci passed 100 only recently, we celebrate this 'century' with an overview of these loci, especially the 59 that have been cloned and sequenced. These fall into a number of functional groups representing melanocyte development and differentiation, melanosomal components, organelle biogenesis, organelle transport, control of pigment-type switching, and some systemic effects. A human ortholog has been identified in all cases, and the majority of these human genes are found to be loci for human disorders, often affecting other body systems as well as pigmentation. We expect that a significant number of color loci remain to be identified. Nonetheless, the large number known already provide a treasury of resources for reconstruction of the mechanisms, at the subcellular, cellular and tissue levels, that produce a functional pigmentary system and contribute to the normal development and functioning of many other organ systems. The mutant mice also provide valuable models for the study of human disease.},

abstract = {Fairy armadillos or pichiciegos (Xenarthra, Dasypodidae) are among the most elusive mammals. Due to their subterranean and nocturnal lifestyle, their basic biology and evolutionary history remain virtually unknown. Two distinct species with allopatric distributions are recognized: Chlamyphorus truncatus is restricted to central Argentina, while Calyptophractus retusus occurs in the Gran Chaco of Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. To test their monophyly and resolve their phylogenetic affinities within armadillos, we obtained sequence data from modern and museum specimens for two mitochondrial genes (12S RNA [MT-RNR1] and NADH dehydrogenase 1 [MT-ND1]) and two nuclear exons (breast cancer 1 early onset exon 11 [BRCA1] and von Willebrand factor exon 28 [VWF]). Phylogenetic analyses provided a reference phylogeny and timescale for living xenarthran genera. Our results reveal monophyletic pichiciegos as members of a major armadillo subfamily (Chlamyphorinae). Their strictly fossorial lifestyle probably evolved as a response to the Oligocene aridification that occurred in South America after their divergence from Tolypeutinae around 32 million years ago (Mya). The ancient divergence date ({\~{}}17. Mya) for separation between the two species supports their taxonomic classification into distinct genera. The synchronicity with Middle Miocene marine incursions along the Paran{\'{a}} river basin suggests a vicariant origin for pichiciegos by the disruption of their ancestral range. Their phylogenetic distinctiveness and rarity in the wild argue in favor of high conservation priority. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Animal colour patterns are adaptive for three reasons: camouflage, communication and physico-physiological functions. This study proposes a conceptual framework for predicting the main adaptive function of carnivore colour patterns based on three factors: visibility, shape and location on the body, as well as, their behavioural ecological correlates. Using a comparative phylogenetic approach, the colour patterns present on the body, the tail and the eyes of 200 species of mammalian carnivores were analysed. Their evolutionary history was reconstructed using MacClade and Maddison's concentrated-changes test was used to test the association between species' colour patterns and their behavioural ecology on a composite phylogeny for all the Carnivora. The results for dark spots, vertical stripes, horizontal stripes, ringed tails, black tail tips, white tail tips, dark eye contour and dark eye patches, are presented. The comparative analyses indicate that spotted, vertically striped and horizontally striped coats evolved for camouflage. Tail markings seem to have evolved for intra- and/or inter-specific communication, while dark markings near and around the eyes are associated with variables consistent with a physico-physiological function. These findings suggest that both the physical environment and animal behaviour are important selective factors driving the evolution of animal colour patterns and that both need to be taken into consideration in future studies of animal coloration.},

abstract = {Forest rehabilitation activities have been initiated on degraded peatland at several sites in Southeast Asia. In order to achieve rehabilitation efficiently and on the largest possible scale, cost-effective, transferable methods need to be established. One potential method, which has previously proven successful in both temperate and neotropical forest ecosystems, is the construction of artificial bird perches outside the forest edge. These provide resting perches for frugivorous birds, encouraging them to fly out of the forest, thus increasing seed dispersal and subsequent seedling recruitment into the degraded area. This method was trialled for the first time in degraded tropical peat swamp forest in Indonesia. The results show that the perches were used by frugivorous birds, leading to a significant increase in seed dispersal; however, seedling recruitment was not increased. The frugivorous birds using the perches were degraded zone species and dispersed mainly tree species from the degraded area. Furthermore, while some seeds of forest-area tree species were dispersed, largely only the degraded area tree species survived to seedling stage. Neither seasonality nor distance from forest edge proved to be significant factors influencing seed dispersal or seedling recruitment, the latter highlighting that seeds were principally being dispersed from within the degraded area rather than from the forest. Although artificial perches did increase seed dispersal, their use as an actual restoration tool in the process of forest regeneration on degraded tropical peatland is limited. Furthermore, when the cost- and effort-to-area factors are considered, this method is shown to be inefficient.},

abstract = {Understanding space use by animals plays a key role in a wide array of behavioural and ecological fields of study. An insight into how and why species use the space available to them may aid their conservation. The West European hedgehog, . Erinaceus europaeus, a species in decline in part of its range, is relatively mobile and adapted to a wide range of habitat types. However, it is frequently associated with edge habitats. This edge-refuging behaviour is not well understood and may be the result of fear of predators, food availability or other factors. We used radiotelemetry to investigate the movement of hedgehogs in comparable landscapes with high and low predator (badgers, . Meles meles) abundance. Simultaneously, food availability was assessed in both landscapes. Our results suggest that agricultural habitats may be 'landscapes of fear' for hedgehogs in the presence of a high number of predators. On agricultural fields, hedgehogs were on average situated closer to edge cover in areas with predators present. It is thus likely to be beneficial for the conservation of hedgehogs in areas with a high number of predators to increase the complexity of the habitat structure by, among other measures, establishing more and denser hedgerows in rural areas. Our results suggest that enhancing the complexity of the habitat structure might lessen the effects of fear. Additionally, our results emphasize the importance of integrating data on predator abundance and food availability in studies that focus on habitat selection behaviour and species conservation. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

This study evaluated whether there are differences in morphological characteristics of passerine birds between two zones with different degrees of disturbance for which catches were made with mist nets and morphometric characters of individuals captured were recorded. It was found that there are differences in morphology between areas and these are mainly due to the relationship between tarsus length, wings and tail with the total length. From these relationships, two basic morphologies were established. Forest birds have short wings, long tail and long tarsus, while birds of the perturbated area have long wings, short tail and short tarsus. However, we found birds with intermediate morphologies in both areas. Therefore, intervened habitats change not only the composition of species but also the morphological characteristics of Passeriformes assemblies probably due to a biotic homogenization process.

abstract = {Within a species, home-range size can vary due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this study we test the hypotheses that social group sizes (intrinsic) of capybaras ( Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris ) and food availability in their habitat (extrinsic) affect their home-range sizes. We used the minimum convex polygon method to estimate home-range sizes and core areas (the area in which each group was present during all seasons). Home-range size estimates varied from 11.3 ha to 27.6 ha (![Graphic][1]{\textless}/img{\textgreater} ha ± 1.89 SE ). Core area accounted for a mean 22.5{\%} of the total home-range size. Home ranges measured during autumn and winter were significantly larger than those recorded in spring and summer. The correlation between home-range size and mean number of adults in groups was marginally significant, whereas that between home-range size and the overall average group size was not significant. We observed a significant negative linear correlation between home-range size and estimators of food availability. The evidence that we determined does not allow us to establish any relationship between group size and home-range size, but it lends support to the hypothesis that the abundance of food resources is a major limiting factor in determining home-range size.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n [1]: /embed/inline-graphic-1.gif},

abstract = {Natal dispersal is a strategy employed by individuals to avoid reproducing with close relatives. In most bats, incestuous matings are prevented by the departure of one sex; thus, all-offspring philopatry has rarely been recorded in these mammals. Here we present evidence of all-offspring philopatry to natal groups in a Neotropical insectivorous bat. Our results are derived from behavioural observations of a long-term, capture-mark-recapture study conducted on three populations of Spix's disc-winged bat, Thyroptera tricolor. Results indicate that dispersal patterns of this species are characterized by low emigration rates (0.40-0.73 individuals per year), long residence times (492-1238 days) and high offspring retention of both sexes within natal groups. The retention of offspring resulted in groups being primarily composed of one or two matrilines. Our study is the first to demonstrate such high amounts of male and female natal philopatry coupled with limited spatial movements in bats. These dispersal patterns may be explained by morphological and ecological constraints associated with costly flight dynamics and significant variation in the distribution and quality of habitat, in addition to social benefits accrued by remaining affiliated with close kin. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Recent research on space use and social behavior of small mammals has revealed pronounced differences in the degree of territoriality between species and between sexes within species. Hypotheses to explain these differences have been based on optimality approaches. Leading hypotheses are that the spatial distribution, abundance and renewal rates of food resources determine whether females defend territories, and that the spatial and temporal pattern of availability of females determines whether males are territorial. Other hypotheses invoke resources other than food, or maintain that territoriality in females deters infanticide. This review briefly summarizes these hypotheses and evaluates recently collected evidence from comparative and experimental studies. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Land-use change is a key driver of the global biodiversity crisis and a particularly serious threat to tropical biodiversity. Throughout the tropics, the staggering pace of deforestation, logging, and conversion of forested habitat to other land uses has created highly fragmented landscapes that are increasingly dominated by human-modified habitats and degraded forests. In this chapter, we review the responses of tropical bats to a range of land-use change scenarios, focusing on the effects of habitat fragmentation, logging, and conversion of tropical forest to various forms of agricultural production. Recent landscape-scale studies have considerably advanced our understanding of how tropical bats respond to habitat fragmentation and disturbance at the population, ensemble, and assemblage level. This research emphasizes that responses of bats are often species and ensemble specific, sensitive to spatial scale, and strongly molded by the characteristics of the prevailing landscape matrix. Nonetheless, substantial knowledge gaps exist concerning other types of response by bats. Few studies have assessed responses at the genetic, behavioral, or physiological level, with regard to disease prevalence, or},

Group territoriality is exhibited in a diverse range of species and is associated with complex behaviors such as cooperation and altruism. Current hypotheses for the evolutionary transition from solitary to group territoriality consider resource dispersion and population density as the primary drivers. We developed a spatially explicit, agent-based simulation model based on African lions (Panthera leo) to explore the evolution of group territoriality across a range of landscape heterogeneities and population densities. We also examined, within these differing landscapes, how 3 potential behavioral advantages to group territoriality (cooperative defense, increase in territory size, and territorial inheritance) influence the evolution of this trait. Simulation results demonstrate that group territoriality may be an emergent property, which evolves due to synergistic interactions of landscape structure, population density, and behavior. Social individuals were significantly more likely to dominate in both resource-poor and resource-rich, heterogeneous landscapes where individuals exhibit all 3 behavioral traits. Similar environment-behavior interactions may have shaped the evolution of sociality from solitary territoriality across a broad range of taxa.},

abstract = {Facilitation is an important ecological mechanism with potential applications to forest restoration. We hypothesized that different facilitation treatments, distance from the forest edge and time since initiation of the experiment would affect forest restoration on abandoned pastures. Seed and seedling abundance, species richness and composition were recorded monthly during two years under isolated trees, bird perches and in open pasture. Seed arrival and seedling establishment were measured at 10. m and 300. m from the forest edge. We sampled a total of 131,826 seeds from 115 species and 487 seedlings from 46 species. Isolated trees and bird perches increased re-establishment of forest species; however, species richness was higher under isolated trees. Overall, abundance and richness of seeds and seedlings differed between sampling years, but was unaffected by distance from the forest edge. On the other hand, species composition of seeds and seedlings differed among facilitation treatments, distance from the forest edge and between years. Seedling establishment success rate was larger in large-seeded species than medium- and small-seeded species. Our results suggest that isolated trees enhance forest re-establishment, while bird perches provide a complementary effort to restore tree abundance in abandoned pastures. However, the importance of seed arrival facilitation shifts toward establishment facilitation over time. Arriving species may vary depending on the distance from the forest edge and disperser attractors. Efforts to restore tropical forests on abandoned pastures should take into account a combination of both restoration strategies, effects of time and proximity to forest edge to maximize regeneration. {\textcopyright} 2013 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

abstract = {Kernel density estimation is a widely used method for estimating a distribution based on a sample of points drawn from that distribution. Generally, in practice some form of error contaminates the sample of observed points. Such error can be the result of imprecise measurements or observation bias. Often this error is negligible and may be disregarded in analysis. In cases where the error is non-negligible, estimation methods should be adjusted to reduce resulting bias. Several modifications of kernel density estimation have been developed to address specific forms of errors. One form of error that has not yet been addressed is the case where observations are nominally placed at the centers of areas from which the points are assumed to have been drawn, where these areas are of varying sizes. In this scenario, the bias arises because the size of the error can vary among points and some subset of points can be known to have smaller error than another subset or the form of the error may change among points. This paper proposes a "contingent kernel density estimation" technique to address this form of error. This new technique adjusts the standard kernel on a point-by-point basis in an adaptive response to changing structure and magnitude of error. In this paper, equations for our contingent kernel technique are derived, the technique is validated using numerical simulations, and an example using the geographic locations of social networking users is worked to demonstrate the utility of the method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Fortmann-Roe et al.},

abstract = {This research presents time-geographic density estimation (TGDE) as a new technique of animal home range analysis in geographic information science (GIS). TGDE combines methodologies of time geography and statistical density estimation to produce a continuous probability distribution of an object's spatial position over time. Once TGDE is applied to animal tracking data to create a density surface, home ranges and core areas can be delineated using specified contours of relative intensity (e.g., 95{\%} or 50{\%}). This article explores the use of TGDE for home range analysis using three data sets: a fixed-interval simulated data set and two variable-interval satellite tracks for a loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) corresponding to internesting and post-migration foraging periods. These applications are used to illustrate the influence of several parameters, including sample size, temporal sampling scheme, selected distance-weighted geoellipse function, and specified maximum velocity, on home range estimates. The results demonstrate how TGDE produces reasonable home range estimates even given irregular tracking data with wide temporal gaps. The advantages of TGDE as compared with traditional methods of home range estimation such as kernel density estimation are as follows: (1) intensities are not assigned to locations where the animal could not have been located given space and time constraints; (2) the density surface represents the actual uncertainty about an animal's spatial position during unsampled time periods; (3) the amount of smoothing applied is objectively specified based on the animal's movement velocity rather than arbitrarily chosen; and (4) uneven sampling intervals are easily accommodated since the density estimates are calculated based on the elapsed time between observed locations. In summary, TGDE is a useful method of home range estimation and shows promise for numerous applications to moving objects in GIS.},

We derive an approximate deterministic population dynamics model keeping track of spatial structure, via spatial moment equations, from an individual-based spatial consumer-resource model; where space-use of consumers resembles that of central place foragers. Using invasion analyses, we investigate how the evolutionarily stable home range size of the consumer depends on a number of ecological and behavioral traits of both the resource and the consumer. We show that any trait variation leading to a decreased overall resource production or an increased spatial segregation between consumer and resource acts to increase consumer home range size. In this way, we extend theoretical predictions on optimal territory size to a larger range of ecological scenarios where home ranges overlap and population dynamics feedbacks are possible. Consideration of spatial traits such as dispersal distances also generates new results: (1) consumer home range size decreases with increased resource dispersal distance, and (2) when consumer agonistic behavior is weak, more philopatric consumers have larger home ranges. Finally, our results emphasize the role of the spatial correlation between consumer and resource distributions in determining home range size, and suggest resource dispersion is less important. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Theory and empirical evidence have long suggested that some species are extremely vulnerable to extinction because they have combinations of extinction promoting traits. However, ecologists have not considered whether the form of the relationship between traits is additive (not synergistic) or nonadditive (synergistic). We looked at how traits and their interactions were related to the difference in species' population growth rates between experimentally fragmented forest and continuous forest. Two traits acted synergistically; natural abundance and degree of specialization interacted so that beetle species that were rare and specialized had a greater reduction in their growth rates in fragments, compared to continuous forest, than the sum of the reductions in growth rates attributable to these traits. In other words, species that were both rare and specialized were especially vulnerable to extinction. From a conservation perspective, an implication of our findings is that making predictions about extinction risk from a single trait, like abundance or population variability, may be risky because traits may act synergistically rendering species more, or less, vulnerable than predicted by that single trait. There is currently a great deal of interest in which traits predict the sensitivity of species to a given threat, but if we are going to look at risks in this way, then we also need to consider how traits interact, because this can alter the vulnerability of species.},

abstract = {Statisticians frequently voice concern that their interactions with applied researchers start only after data have been collected. The same can be said for our experience with home-range studies. Too often, conversations about home range begin with questions concerning estimation methods, smoothing parameters, or the nature of autocorrelation. More productive efforts start by asking good (and interesting) research questions; once these questions are defined, it becomes possible to ask how various design and analysis strategies influence one's ability to answer these questions. With this process in mind, we address key sample-design and data-analysis issues related to the topic of home range. The impact of choosing a particular home-range estimator (e.g., minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, or local convex hull) will be question dependent, and for some problems other movement or use- based metrics (e.g., mean step lengths or time spent in particular areas) may be worthy of consideration. Thus, we argue the need for more question-driven and focused research and for clearly distinguishing the biological concept of an animal's home range from the statistical quantities one uses to investigate this concept. For comparative studies, it is important to standardize sampling regimes and estimation methods as much as possible, and to pay close attention to missing data issues. More attention should also be given to temporally changing space-use patterns, with biologically meaningful time periods (e.g., life-history stages) used to define sampling periods. Last, we argue the need for closer connections between theoretical and empirical researchers. Advances in ecological theory, and its application to natural resources management, will require carefully designed research studies to test theoretical predictions from more mechanistic modeling approaches.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clarify prognostic factors of long-term visual outcome without treatment in patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and estimate a regression equation to predict visual acuity at 5 years after CNV onset. METHODS: Fifty-four eyes of 54 consecutive patients with high myopia and subfoveal CNV who did not receive treatment were identified using clinical records from 1988 to 2004. Photodynamic therapy not approved for myopic CNV in Japan during this period. The association of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 5 years after CNV onset with patient age, refractive error, axial length, initial BCVA, myopic retinopathy grade, duration of persistent hemorrhage, CNV size at onset, and size of hemorrhage around the CNV was analyzed using Spearman's correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: BCVA at 5 years after onset was significantly associated with patient age, CNV size, and initial BCVA (P{\textless}0.05, Spearman's correlation). The regression equation estimating BCVA at 5 years after CNV onset was based on age and initial BCVA (R2=0.43). When subjects were divided into groups according to age ({\textless}40 and {\textgreater}or=40 years), CNV size, axial length and duration of persistent hemorrhage influenced BCVA at 5 years in patients under 40 years; while only initial BCVA was an influence in those at least 40 years old. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a linear predictive model to estimate BCVA at 5 years after onset of myopic CNV without treatment based on the identified prognostic factors. This information might be important for managing patients with myopic CNV.},

abstract = {Inferring the role of interactions in territorial animals relies upon accurate recordings of the behaviour of neighbouring individuals. Such accurate recordings are rarely available from field studies. As a result, quantification of the interaction mechanisms has often relied upon theoretical approaches, which hitherto have been limited to comparisons of macroscopic population-level predictions from un-tested interaction models. Here we present a quantitative framework that possesses a microscopic testable hypothesis on the mechanism of conspecific avoidance mediated by olfactory signals in the form of scent marks. We find that the key parameters controlling territoriality are two: the average territory size, i.e. the inverse of the population density, and the time span during which animal scent marks remain active. Since permanent monitoring of a territorial border is not possible, scent marks need to function in the temporary absence of the resident. As chemical signals carried by the scent only last a finite amount of time, each animal needs to revisit territorial boundaries frequently and refresh its own scent marks in order to deter possible intruders. The size of the territory an animal can maintain is thus proportional to the time necessary for an animal to move between its own territorial boundaries. By using an agent-based model to take into account the possible spatio-temporal movement trajectories of individual animals, we show that the emerging territories are the result of a form of collective animal movement where, different to shoaling, flocking or herding, interactions are highly heterogeneous in space and time. The applicability of our hypothesis has been tested with a prototypical territorial animal, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes).},

Natal coats began to change at 5.7 weeks and disappeared by 18.0 weeks postpartum on average. The first body part to lose natal coloration was the head and/or dorsum in the majority of species. Functional analyses provided no support for the only published hypothesis-alloparental-while providing partial support for two new hypotheses-infant defense and paternity cloak. A significant association between testes weight and natal coat contrast supports a link between mating system and infant contrast. This is discussed in terms of infanticide avoidance. Natal coats are proposed to be categorically differentiated into inconspicuous and flamboyant types, not differentiated by a continuous gradation, such as color.

abstract = {Spix's disc-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor) forms cohesive groups despite using an extremely ephemeral roost, partly due to the use of two acoustic signals that help individuals locate roost sites and group members. While the calls that aid in group cohesion are commonly used, some bats rarely or never produce them. Here, we examine whether the differences observed in the contact calling behaviour of T. tricolor are repeatable; that is, whether individual differences are consistent. We recorded contact calls of individuals in the field and rates and patterns of vocalization. To determine whether measured variables were consistent within individuals, we estimated repeatability (R), which compares within-individual to among-individual variance in behavioural traits. Our results show that repeatability for call variables was moderate but significant, and that repeatability was highest for the average number of calls produced (R=0.46–0.49). Our results demonstrate important individual differences in the contact calling behaviour of T. tricolor; we discuss how these could be the result of mechanisms such as frequency-dependent selection that favour groups composed of individuals with diverse vocal strategies. Future work should address whether changes in social environment, specifically group membership and social status, affect vocal behaviour. Electronic},

abstract = {The restricted area of space used by most mobile animals is thought to result from fitness-rewarding decisions derived from gaining information about the environment. Yet, assessments of how animals deal with uncertainty using memory have been largely theoretical, and an empirically derived mechanism explaining restricted space use in animals is still lacking. Using a patch-to-patch movement analysis, we investigated predictions of how free-ranging bison (Bison bison) living in a meadow-forest matrix use memory to reduce uncertainty in energy intake rate. Results indicate that bison remembered pertinent information about location and quality of meadows, and they used this information to selectively move to meadows of higher profitability. Moreover, bison chose profitable meadows they had previously visited, and this choice was stronger after visiting a relatively poor quality meadow. Our work demonstrates a link between memory, energy gains and restricted space use while establishing a fitness-based integration of movement, cognitive and spatial ecology.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the Ecological Society of America. Habitat fragmentation can create significant impediments to dispersal. A technique to increase dispersal between otherwise isolated fragments is the use of corridors. Although previous studies have compared dispersal between connected fragments to dispersal between unconnected fragments, it remains unknown how dispersal between fragments connected by a corridor compares to dispersal in unfragmented landscapes. To assess the extent to which corridors can restore dispersal in fragmented landscapes to levels observed in unfragmented landscapes, we employed a stable-isotope marking technique to track seeds within four unfragmented landscapes and eight experimental landscapes with fragments connected by corridors. We studied two wind-and two bird-dispersed plant species, because previous community-based research showed that dispersal mode explains how connectivity effects vary among species. We constructed dispersal kernels for these species in unfragmented landscapes and connected fragments by marking seeds in the center of each landscape with 15N and then recovering marked seeds in seed traps at distances up to 200 m. For the two wind-dispersed plants, seed dispersal kernels were similar in unfragmented landscapes and connected fragments. In contrast, dispersal kernels of birddispersed seeds were both affected by fragmentation and differed in the direction of the impact: Morella cerifera experienced more and Rhus copallina experienced less long-distance dispersal in unfragmented than in connected landscapes. These results show that corridors can facilitate dispersal probabilities comparable to those observed in unfragmented landscapes. Although dispersal mode may provide useful broad predictions, we acknowledge that similar species may respond uniquely due to factors such as seasonality and disperser behavior. Our results further indicate that prior work has likely underestimated dispersal distances of wind-dispersed plants and that factors altering long-distance dispersal may have a greater impact on the spread of species than previously thought.},

abstract = {General insights into the causes and effects of social structure can be gained from comparative analyses across socially and ecologically diverse taxa, such as bats, but long-term data are lacking for most species. In the neotropical fringe-lipped bat, Trachops cirrhosus, social transmission of foraging behaviour is clearly demonstrated in captivity, yet its social structure in the wild remains unclear. Here, we used microsatellite-based estimates of relatedness and records of 157 individually marked adults from 106 roost captures over 6 years, to infer whether male and female T. cirrhosus have preferred co-roosting associations and whether such associations were influenced by relatedness. Using a null model that controlled for year and roosting location, we found that both male and female T. cirrhosus have preferred roosting partners, but that only females demonstrate kin-biased association. Most roosting groups (67{\%}) contained multiple females with one or two reproductive males. Relatedness patterns and recapture records corroborate genetic evidence for female philopatry and male dispersal. Our study adds to growing evidence that many bats demonstrate preferred roosting associations, which has the potential to influence social information transfer.},

abstract = {Artificial perches are used in tropical forest restoration projects to increase the dispersal of seeds into restored areas. The ability of perches to enhance seed deposition depends on their ability to attract seed dispersing birds, as well as the correlation between the season of bird visits to perches and the phenology of fruit production in adjacent forests. Using data collected from a large-scale restoration project, we characterized the community of birds that utilize artificial perches over the course of one year. We hypothesized that the structure of a bird assemblage that uses artificial perches is affected by seasonal variation. We aimed to describe the richness, abundance and diversity of a bird assemblage on artificial perches in a subtropical Atlantic forest restoration experiment in Southern Brazil. Richness and abundance estimates of the avian fauna were obtained from eight artificial perches placed in four experimental plots (∼2 y-old). Parameters of richness and abundance were compared using ANOVA. The bird assemblage was described using SHE analysis [richness (S), diversity (H') and evenness (E)], with additional estimates of occurrence and dominance. In total, 451 records of 32 ± 3.16 SD species were obtained. Thraupidae was the most numerous family (nine species, 28.12{\%} of the total). Richness and abundance varied seasonally and were highest during spring and summer. Five migratory species of flycatchers were recorded between spring and early autumn. Perches were ineffective in attracting specialized frugivorous birds, emphasizing that seed dispersal tends to be carried out primarily by generalist omnivores in the initial phase of forest regeneration.Poleiros artificiais s{\~{a}}o usados em projetos de restaura{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de florestas tropicais para aumentar a dispers{\~{a}}o de sementes em {\'{a}}reas restauradas.

Application of the kernel probability density estimation method to the description of animal home ranges, coupled with the mapping and analytical capabilities available in geographic information systems, allow researchers to gain a degree of insight into species' habitat use that has not previously been possible. This paper provides examples of habitat selection analyses performed using home range contours produced in the program KERNELHR and input into the Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) where home range contours were overlain on habitat maps. Data for the examples were taken from a study of the Southern Flying Squirrel (Glaucomys volans) in fragmented forests in Arkansas, where flying squirrels were tracked by radiotelemetry on five study areas during spring and summer 1994-1996. However, the methods described here may also be applied similarly to other terrestrial vertebrates.},

abstract = {During the mid-1900s, most of the island of Puerto Rico was deforested, but a shift in the economy from agriculture to small industry beginning in the 1950s resulted in the abandonment of agricultural lands and recovery of secondary forest. This unique history pro-vides an excellent opportunity to study secondary for-est succession and suggest strategies for tropical for-est restoration. To determine the pattern of secondary succession, we describe the woody vegetation in 71 abandoned pastures and forest sites in four regions of Puerto Rico. The density, basal area, aboveground biomass, and species richness of the secondary forest sites were similar to those of the old growth forest sites (Ͼ 80 yr) after approximately 40 years. The domi-nant species that colonized recently abandoned pas-tures occurred over a broad elevational range and are widespread in the neotropics. The species richness of Puerto Rican secondary forests recovered rapidly, but the species composition was quite different in com-parison with old growth forest sites, suggesting that enrichment planting will be necessary to restore the original composition. Exotic species were some of the most abundant species in the secondary forest, but their long-term impact depended on life history char-acteristics of each species. These data demonstrate that one restoration strategy for tropical forest in abandoned pastures is simply to protect the areas from fire, and allow natural regeneration to produce secondary forest. This strategy will be most effective if remnant forest (i.e., seed sources) still exist in the landscape and soils have not been highly degraded. Patterns of forest recovery also suggest strategies for accelerating natural recovery by planting a suite of generalist species that are common in recently aban-doned pastures in Puerto Rico and throughout much of the neotropics.},

Analyses were conducted with and without taking phylogeny into account. The former analyses were based on a weighted, phylogenetic supertree for all extant species of lagomorphs that we constructed using morphological and molecular data from 146 papers in the literature. Although our analyses represent an initial, somewhat crude investigation, several clear trends are evident. First, overall body coloration across lagomorphs tends to match the background as shown for pale and red coloration and perhaps seasonal pelage change. The case for countershading being a method of concealment is far less strong. Second, ear tips appear to have a communicative role since they are conspicuous in many different habitats. Third, hypotheses for tail tips having a communicative role, for extremities being dark for physiological reasons, and for Gloger's rule received only partial support. {\textcopyright} 2003 The Linnean Society of London.},

The results indicated the foliage-gleaning foraging strategy and the effective resource partitioning. Once a certain diet item comprises an important food resource for one bat species, it is usually exploited much less by the other two bat species, and despite important seasonal dietary changes this pattern lasts throughout the entire season. Dietary composition varies more among the entire guild of forest foliage-gleaning bats than it does between these species and their morphological siblings or evolutionarily related species (e.g., Plecotus auritus vs. P. austriacus or Barbastella barbastellus, Myotis nattereri vs. M. emarginatus). The results are not fully consistent with the predictions of sensory ecology, which presume that bats with longer ears feed more frequently on prey that generates sound. The results do not support the hypothesis that rare bats exploit a narrower range of prey. The relatively rare M. bechsteinii has a wider trophic niche, whereas the more common P. auritus exploits a narrower range of prey. Comparison of dietary composition and morphological and echolocation parameters indicates that larger species feed on harder prey, species with longer ears are moth-eating specialists and species with a higher call intensity exploit small dipterans, probably in uncluttered habitats.},

abstract = {Filtering relevant signals from noisy sensory input is a crucial challenge for animals [1, 2]. Many bats are acoustic specialists relying on sound to find prey. They discern salient acoustic signals from irrelevant background masking noise. It has long been considered a sensory impossibility for bats to use solely echolocation for the detection of silent and motionless prey resting directly on foliage due to the masking effects of background echoes [3, 4]. Some bats, however, do successfully perform this seemingly impossible task [5], raising the question—what underlying acoustic and behavioral mechanisms do bats use to solve this conundrum? To address this question, we used biomimetic sonar to record high-resolution measurements of echoes from insects resting on leaves. Based on our echo recordings, we predicted optimal approach angles from which masking echoes can best be avoided. In behavioral experiments, we put these predictions to test. We recorded the prey approach behavior of wild bats in a flight cage equipped with an ultrasonic microphone synchronized with two high-speed cameras for 3D flightpath reconstructions. Bats approached prey from our predicted optimal oblique angles, using the leaf as a specular reflector to uncover previously acoustically hidden prey. Our findings disclose key behavioral and acoustic mechanisms enabling the detection of prey echoes that background clutter would otherwise mask. This work adds to the fundamental understanding of how bat echolocation strategies can override acoustic camouflage by silent, motionless prey, thus providing new insights into the evolutionary arms race between predators and their prey.},

abstract = {Background Although the impact of the microphthalamia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) signaling pathway on melanocytes progression has been extensively studied, the specific molecular mechanisms behind MITF-M-enhanced melanin production in melanocytes still need to be clarified. Methods In this study, we analyzed the levels of Mitf-M in skin tissues of different coat mice in order to further reveal the relationship between Mitf-M and skin pigmentation. To address the function of Mitf-M on melanogenesis, we have used an overexpression system and combined morphological and biochemical methods to investigate its localization in different coat color mice and pigmentation-related genes' expression in mouse melanocytes. Results The qRT-PCR assay and Western blotting analysis revealed that Mitf-M mRNA and protein were synthesized in all tested mice skin samples, with the highest expression level in brown skin, a moderate expression level in grey skin and the lowest expression level in black skin. Simultaneously, immunofluorescence staining revealed that MITF-M was mainly expressed in the hair follicle matrix and inner and outer root sheath in the skin tissues with different coat colors. Furthermore, overexpression of MITF-M led to increased melanin content and variable pigmentation-related gene expression. Conclusion These results directly demonstrate that MITF-M not only influences melanogenesis, but also determines the progression of melanosomal protein in mouse melanocytes.},

A key goal in ecology is to understand whether and how the many processes that generate these gradients act at different spatial scales. Here we evaluate six hypotheses for diversity gradients with 49 New World ant communities, from tundra to rain forest. We contrast their performance at three spatial grains from Splot, the average number of ant species nesting in a m2 plot, through Fisher's $\alpha$, an index that treats our 30 1-m2 plots as subsamples of a locality's diversity, At the smallest grain, Splot was tightly correlated (r2 = 0.99) with colony abundance in a fashion indistinguishable from the packing of randomly selected individuals into a fixed space. As spatial grain increased, the coaction of two factors linked to high net rates of diversification - warm temperatures and large areas of uniform climate - accounted for 75{\%} of the variation in Fisher's $\alpha$. However, the mechanisms underlying these correlations (i.e., precisely how temperature and area shape the balance of speciation to extinction) remain elusive.},

abstract = {The study of pigmentation has played an important role in the intersection of evolution, genetics, and developmental biology. Pigmentation's utility as a visible phenotypic marker has resulted in over 100 years of intense study of coat color mutations in laboratory mice, thereby creating an impressive list of candidate genes and an understanding of the developmental mechanisms responsible for the phenotypic effects. Variation in color and pigment patterning has also served as the focus of many classic studies of naturally occurring phenotypic variation in a wide variety of vertebrates, providing some of the most compelling cases for parallel and convergent evolution. Thus, the pigmentation model system holds much promise for understanding the nature of adaptation by linking genetic changes to variation in fitness-related traits. Here, I first discuss the historical role of pigmentation in genetics, development and evolutionary biology. I then discuss recent empirically based studies in vertebrates, which rely on these historical foundations to make connections between genotype and phenotype for ecologically important pigmentation traits. These studies provide insight into the evolutionary process by uncovering the genetic basis of adaptive traits and addressing such long-standing questions in evolutionary biology as (1) are adaptive changes predominantly caused by mutations in regulatory regions or coding regions? (2) is adaptation driven by the fixation of dominant mutations? and (3) to what extent are parallel phenotypic changes caused by similar genetic changes? It is clear that coloration has much to teach us about the molecular basis of organismal diversity, adaptation and the evolutionary process. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

Spiders that lose larger larders (i.e., spiders that lose larders consisting of more prey items) search for longer intervals, indicating that the spiders form memories of the size of the prey larders they have accumulated, and use those memories to regulate recovery efforts when the larders are pilfered. Here, we ask whether the spiders represent prey counts (i.e., numerosity) or a continuous integration of prey quantity (mass) in their memories. We manipulated larder sizes in treatments that varied in either prey size or prey numbers but were equivalent in total prey quantity (mass). We then removed the larders to elicit searching and used the spiders' searching behavior as an assay of their representations in memory. Searching increased with prey quantity (larder size) and did so more steeply with higher prey counts than with single prey of larger sizes. Thus, Nephila spiders seem to track prey quantity in two ways, but to attend more to prey numerosity. We discuss alternatives for continuous accumulator mechanisms that remain to be tested against the numerosity hypothesis, and the evolutionary and adaptive significance of evidence suggestive of numerosity in a sit-and-wait invertebrate predator.},

abstract = {Background: Bats are among the most successful desert mammals. Yet, our understanding of their spatio-temporal dynamics in habitat use associated with the seasonal oscillation of resources is still limited. In this study, we have employed state-of-the-art lightweight GPS loggers to track the yellow-winged bat Lavia frons in a desert in northern Kenya to investigate how seasonality in a desert affects the a) spatial and b) temporal dimensions of movements in a low-mobility bat. Methods: Bats were tracked during April-May 2017 (rainy season) and January-February 2018 (dry season) using 1-g GPS loggers. Spatial and temporal dimensions of movements were quantified, respectively, as the home range and nightly activity patterns. We tested for differences between seasons to assess responses to seasonal drought. In addition, we quantified home range overlap between neighbouring individuals to investigate whether tracking data will be in accordance with previous reports on territoriality and social monogamy in L. frons. Results: We obtained data for 22 bats, 13 during the rainy and 9 during the dry season. Home ranges averaged 5.46 ± 11.04 ha and bats travelled a minimum distance of 99.69 ± 123.42 m/hour. During the dry season, home ranges were larger than in the rainy season, and bats exhibited high activity during most of the night. No apparent association with free water was identified during the dry season. The observed spatial organisation of home ranges supports previous observations that L. frons partitions the space into territories throughout the year. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, in low-mobility bats, a potential way to cope with seasonally harsh conditions and resource scarcity in deserts is to cover larger areas and increase time active, suggesting lower cost-efficiency of the foraging activity. Climate change may pose additional pressures on L. frons and other low-mobility species by further reducing food abundances.},

In the size-grain hypothesis (a) long legs allow walking organisms to step over gaps and pores in substrate but prohibit them from entering those gaps; (b) the world is more rugose for small organisms; and (c) the relative cost of long legs increases as organisms grow smaller. The hypothesis predicts a positive allometry of leg length (= massb where b {\textgreater} 0.33 of isometry), a pattern that robustly holds for ants. 2. Toward testing for leg length allometries in other taxa, arthropods were extracted from the Panama leaf litter and measured. Three common taxa (spiders, diplopods, Coleoptera) yielded bs that exceeded 0.33 while three others (Acarina, Pseudoscorpiones, and Collembola) did not. The exponent b tended to increase (P = 0.06, n = 7) with an arthropod taxon's average body mass. 3. Since leg length in cursorial organisms tends toward isometry in very small and very large taxa (i.e. mammals) this suggests that the size-grain hypothesis may best apply at a transition zone of intermediate body mass: the macroarthropods. 4.

abstract = {Resource selection is a function of interactions of organisms (competition, predation) as well as characteristics of the resource and organisms. I provide a quantitative model that integrates these factors. I use the model to predict profitability of fruits to tropical birds, but the model and its predictions are applicable to a wider array of systems and organisms. Profitability of a fruit is determined by rewards provided by the pericarp (mass and caloric yields) relative to costs (metabolic requirements, handling time, search time, behavioral interference, predator avoidance) associated with finding and eating that fruit (Fig. 1). Fruits increase in profitability with increases in fruit size until increases in handling time offset increases in pericarp mass. The fruit size at which increases in handling time offset increases in pericarp mass varies among bird species due to differences in bill and body size. Decreases in feeding rate due to decreasing numbers of fruits and increasing search time causes reduced profitability and this effect becomes more severe with decreasing fruit size and/or increasing frugivore size. Consequently, as fruit size decreases relative to frugivore size, fruit abundance becomes increasingly important to fruit selection by frugivores. However, while profitability of resources is a function of characteristics of the resources and the organisms, biological interactions can change profitability rankings; resources that may be more profitable in the absence of behavioral interference, exploitation competition, or predation risk can become less profitable in the face of these interactions. The proposed model integrates these interactions to provide predictions of resource selection and these predictions are supported by published studies. {\textcopyright} 1985 Springer-Verlag.},

However, little is known regarding the factors influencing space use by rodent social groups. We tested the hypotheses that food resources in the typical steppe would be so abundant that food availability would not be a limiting factor of home-range sizes of social groups of Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). We also assessed the effects of social organization on the home-range size of social groups of gerbils, using capture-recapture methods. Home ranges of social groups of Mongolian gerbils did not differ in size between the breeding and non-breeding periods; however, home ranges overlapped more during the breeding period than during the non-breeding period. Overlap of home ranges might allow male gerbils to access female mates of neighboring colonies during the breeding period. Home-range sizes of social groups were positively related to number of males during the breeding period, but positively related to group size and number of females during the non-breeding period. Therefore, social organization influenced home-range sizes of social groups. Our hypothesis that food availability is not a limiting factor of space use by social groups of Mongolian gerbils from spring through autumn was supported. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Developed to explain species maintenance and diversity patterns in species-rich ecosystems such as tropical forests, tests of IDH in tropical forest remain scarce, small-scale and contentious. We use an unprecedented large-scale dataset (2504 one-hectare plots and 331 567 trees) to examine whether IDH explains tree diversity variation within wet, moist and dry tropical forests, and we analyse the underlying mechanism by determining responses within functional species groups. We find that disturbance explains more variation in diversity of dry than wet tropical forests. Pioneer species numbers increase with disturbance, shade-tolerant species decrease and intermediate species are indifferent. While diversity indeed peaks at intermediate disturbance levels little variation is explained outside dry forests, and disturbance is less important for species richness patterns in wet tropical rain forests than previously thought.},

abstract = {Sharing resources with conspecifics or heterospecifics can involve costs like increased competition or higher pathogen infection risks as well as benefits such as information on the location, quality and availability of resources. Depending on the consequences of sharing resources, the responses of individuals towards resources used by conspecifics and heterospecifics can range from ignoring them through avoidance to attraction. Within bats it is well known that colony members share information about day roosts and roost switching is often coordinated within the colony. However, little is known about roosting interactions between distinct colonies of conspecifics or heterospecifics. In this study, we investigated roosting interactions between five co-occurring bat colonies that belong to three forest-living species (Myotis bechsteinii, Myotis nattereri, Plecotus auritus). Occupied roosts were continuously monitored with an automatic RFID system over three maternity seasons. Furthermore, we used simulations to test whether colonies preferentially occupied recently used roosts of other colonies. We found no evidence that the roosting behaviour of the M. bechsteinii colony was influenced by the co-occurring heterospecific colonies. In contrast, P. auritus and M. nattereri frequently explored roosts of conspecific and heterospecific colonies, respectively. Nevertheless, with largely separated roosting ranges, the three P. auritus colonies avoided occupying roosts that had been inhabited by conspecific colonies. In contrast, M. nattereri specifically occupied recent roosts of all three P. auritus colonies. Our results give evidence that co-occurring colonies of conspecific and heterospecific bats can influence each other's roost usage. Our findings have implications for both our understanding of inter- and intraspecific resource sharing among distinct social groups and the management of forest-living bats that are of conservation concern.},

abstract = {The directed-dispersal (DrD) hypothesis, one of the main explanations for the adaptive value of seed dispersal, asserts that enhanced (nonrandom) arrival to favorable establishment sites is advantageous for plant fitness. However, as anticipated by the ideal free distribution theory, enhanced seed deposition may impair site suitability by increasing density-dependent mortality, thus negating the advantage postulated by the DrD hypothesis. Although the role of density effects is thoroughly discussed in the seed-dispersal literature, this DrD paradox remains largely overlooked. The paradox, however, may be particularly pronounced in animal-mediated dispersal systems, in which DrD is relatively common, because animals tend to generate local seed aggregations due to their nonrandom movements. To investigate possible solutions to the DrD paradox, we first introduce a simple analytical model that calculates the optimal DrD level at which seed arrival to favorable establishment sites yields maximal fitness gain in comparison to a null model of random arrival. This model predicts intermediate optimal DrD levels that correspond to various attributes of the plants, the dispersers, and the habitat. We then use a simulation model to explore the temporal dynamics of the invasion process of the DrD strategy in a randomly dispersed population, and the resistance of a DrD population against invasion of other dispersal strategies. This model demonstrates that some properties of the invasion process (e.g., mutant persistence ratio in the population and generations until initial establishment) are facilitated by high DrD levels, and not by intermediate levels as expected from the analytical model. These results highlight the need to revise the DrD hypothesis to include the countering effects of density-dependent mortality inherently imposed by enhanced arrival of seeds to specific sites. We illustrate how the revised hypothesis can elucidate previous results from empirical studies reporting little or no support for the DrD hypothesis, and we suggest its incorporation in designing empirical studies of plant recruitment and in management practices.},

abstract = {Aggressive behaviors are used to defend and maintain territories. Although there are benefits in maintaining a territory, there are also important costs, including energy expenditure and risk of injury. In most species, aggressive behaviors are highly regulated, and a variety of hormonal and neurobiological mechanisms have been identified. Recent studies have begun to outline how these mechanisms are affected by variation in the environment. In birds and rodents, different hormonal mechanisms regulate aggression in different seasons and photoperiod regimes. Modulation through social experience adds to this plasticity in aggression. In particular, previous experience winning aggressive encounters increases the probability of winning future encounters, regardless of intrinsic fighting ability. In males, this effect appears to be facilitated by testosterone, and there are hints that progesterone may be important in females. Since aggressive behavior does not occur in a vacuum, it is critical to consider how variations in the environment affect the mechanisms regulating aggression.},

abstract = {Home ranges of animals are associated with the spatial distribution of limiting resources on a landscape, yet no mechanistic models representing this relationship exist. We present models of how animals might choose patches for their home ranges in ways that are optimal with respect to spatially distributed resources. The models assume that animals choose patches for their home ranges based on resource benefits discounted for travel costs. Animals might select patches to maximize resources within their home ranges over random use of the landscape (resource maximization), or to satisfy a minimum resource threshold needed for survival or reproduction (area minimization). We evaluated how landscape configuration structures home ranges of animals by performing individual-based, spatially explicit computer simulations using each model on simulated landscapes that differed only in the spatial continuity of resources among patches (from over-dispersed to clumped). The most important factor determining quality, efficiency, resource content, and spatial distribution of home ranges was the extent to which resources were clumped on a landscape. Characteristics of resource-maximizing home ranges were determined only by the distribution of resources, and differed from those of area-minimizing home ranges depending upon the magnitude of the resource threshold required. An increase in resource threshold increased area and total resource content for area-minimizing home ranges, but did not change their quality or efficiency. Because animals can consume or protect resources within their home ranges, they can depress the value of resources available to other animals and hence how those animals will choose their home ranges. Depression of resource values on a landscape by animals should result in different configuration and spatial distribution of home ranges on a landscape than would be predicted in its absence. We modified the two home range models to depress the value of resources available to other animals within patches selected for each home range. We generated home ranges with the new models on the simulated landscapes and evaluated how home ranges with resource depression varied with landscape configuration and with the number of home ranges on the landscape. We compared characteristics and spatial distribution of home ranges with resource depression to those of home ranges that do not. For the number of simulations we performed, resource depression resulted in home ranges that differed little in configuration and landscape interactions from those without, except that they were distributed more evenly on the landscapes and overlapped each other less. As the number of home ranges on a landscape increased, resource distributions declined in quality and heterogeneity, and home ranges became larger, less efficient, and of lower quality. Our results suggest that, in addition to landscape configuration, the extent to which animals depress resources included in their home ranges should determine the evenness of spatial dispersion, overlap, and home range structure, especially where animals select home ranges to satisfy a specific resource threshold and the density of animals is high. Because resource depression sets a limit on the number of home ranges a landscape with fixed resource levels can support, our models provide a means of assessing carrying capacity of a landscape. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Aims: Home ranges, habitat use and selection of Dupont's Lark Chersophilus duponti during the breeding and postbreeding periods were analysed using radiotagged birds. Location: Layna, central Spain (Soria, 41°05'N, 1°50'W; 1200 m a.s.l.). Methods: A total of 32 birds were radiotagged (22 males, 4 females and 6 juveniles) and monitored nearly daily from April 1st to September 1st. The following variables were measured (1) home ranges using the Minimum Convex Poligon, MCP, (2) core areas using the kernel 80 {\%} density estimator, (3) the distance between successive daily locations, and (4) the degree of overlap of between individuals and periods in home ranges and core areas using Cole's Index of Concordance. The use and selection of vegetation formations was studied on an individual basis comparing the percentage of bird locations and random points in each vegetation unit. The selection of habitat structure was measured along transects within the birds' home ranges and compared to that measured along random transects outside home ranges. Results: Home ranges (mean, 8.1 ha), core areas (3.7 ha) and the distance between successive daily locations (around 120 m) did not differ between age-sex classes, or between periods in either sex. Juveniles showed larger core areas and movements than adults during the post-breeding period. Overlap between neighbouring males, as well as between juveniles and adults during the postbreeding period, was scarce in comparison with the overlap between members of the same pair or the overlap between the periods. Two males (9.1{\%}) changed their home ranges during the breeding period, and the only fledgling captured near its nest stayed within paternal home range until at least 1 month old. The density in the study area was 1.0 males/10ha. Dupont's Lark positively selected Genista pumila shrubs and negatively Genista scorpius shrubs, dry pastures and cereal fields. There were no differences between sexes, nor between periods among adults. Selection by juveniles differed from adult selection during the postbreeding period, using dry pastures more frequently than Genista pumila shrubs. Birds positively selected areas of high pillow-shape shrub cover at ground level, avoiding those of high tall-shrub cover at ground level. A binary logistic regression model including only pillow-shaped shrub cover at ground level as explanatory variable, correctly predicted 76{\%} of home ranges, as confirmed by jacknife re-sampling estimation. Conclusions: Three main conclusions can be drawn from a conservation perspective: (1) the species' territorial behaviour and strict habitat selection make it highly vulnerable to habitat changes, imposing careful habitat management; (2) management should also regard the marginal habitats used by juveniles; (3) the low density found in one of the best areas for the species in Iberia supports the low estimates of the Spanish population of the Dupont's Lark made in previous studies.},

abstract = {The extent to which a resource (e.g. nest site, food resource) is available and utilised in the wild is of fundamental importance to the understanding of species' biology, community ecology, and for evidence-based conservation and habitat management. However, dynamics of resource use is challenging to study because it is likely determined by a complex set of (often unknown) factors and their interactions, and because of imperfect and biased detection rates (usually false absences). In this study we test for multiple drivers of summer roosting site occupancy by bats, using a rigorous statistical framework that combines multi-state occupancy models with two-class heterogeneity models. Understanding the utilization of this critical resource is a pre-requisite for any successful conservation management of (often declining) bat populations. We evaluated the importance of several external and internal sources of inter-annual roost occupancy dynamics in a community of three sympatric woodland bat species: weather, roost spatial position, roost intrinsic (unmeasurable) quality, memory effect in roost use, and inter-species dynamics. We identified the existence of two classes of the roost's intrinsic quality, and showed that bats tend to re-occupy previously occupied roosts irrespective of the roost intrinsic quality (memory effect). At the landscape scale, distance from water but not from the woodland edge influenced occupancy dynamics, with roosts closer to water having higher probability of being occupied. We also identified species-specific patterns of roost occupancy, colonisation and extinction, and between-species roost interchange. Our statistically powerful and flexible modelling approach can distinguish between multiple drivers of resource occupancy: measurable factors (environmental conditions and resource traits), unmeasurable (hidden or unknown) factors, previous use of the resource (memory effect) and community-level interactions. As such, it can be used to identify important areas for species (or communities), as well as to test evolutionary and ecological hypotheses concerning resource utilisation.},

Ventral speckles first appear in the genital area at a mean age of 10.2 ± 0.35 yr (range = 7.6-12.7 yr). Throughout their life span, speckles increase in number and density, particularly along the ventral and lateral sides. The timing of speckle onset does not significantly differ by sex but is related to sexual maturity in females. The age of speckle onset in the genital area correlates with the age of first known parturition. In terms of speckle function, we discuss two hypotheses commonly proffered to explain color variation, concealment, and communication. Concealment from predators or prey is unlikely to explain speckle development in Shark Bay Tursiops because the onset occurs long after peak predation risk and initial hunting success (at 3 mo of age). We suggest that speckle patterns offer reliable cues on reproductive status and/or condition and could, thus, serve a communicative or some other function. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the Society for Marine Mammalogy.},

Relevant relationships could only be demonstrated for directly scale-dependent parameters (scale area, scale perimeter, ratio of scale width to height). However, the species-specific shape and size of hair cuticle scales in mammals may be of certain value for biological interpretations of hair coat structure and function. This seems to be especially true for the Canidae and the Felidae, and even more for small mammals (insectivores, chiropterans, small rodents). In the latter group relationships between scale-dependent parameters and hair coat density indicate a homogeneity of hair coat structure which reflects effective insulation qualities.},

Tactic use in producer-scrounger games is partly flexible but individuals tend to show consistency in tactic use under different conditions suggesting that personality might play a role in tactic use in producer-scrounger games. Here we studied the use of producing and scrounging tactics by bold and shy barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis), where boldness is a personality trait known to be repeatable over time in this species. We defined individuals as bold, shy or intermediate based on two novel object tests. We scored the frequency of finding food patches (the outcome of investing in producing) and joining patches (the outcome of investing in scrounging) by bold and shy individuals and their feeding time. Shy individuals had a higher frequency of joining than bold individuals, demonstrating for the first time that personality is associated with tactic use in a producer-scrounger game. Bold individuals tended to spend more time feeding than shy individuals. Our results highlight the importance of including individual behavioural variation in models of producer-scrounger games.},

We matched the position and coloration of contrasting markings on the bodies of all even-toed ungulates to ecological and social variables in order to ask whether marks are used in communication generally, as a signal to predators, or as a signal to conspecifics. Controlling for phylogeny, we found that many marks are located in prominent visible positions on the body; that flank marks seem to amplify stotting and leaping, which are pursuit deterrent signals; and that front leg marks may amplify foot stamping, an antipredator signal. We found that upper leg markings, particularly markings on the podials, are associated with group living hinting at an intraspecific communicatory function. Surprisingly, we found that contrasting marks do not reliably indicate position of scent glands across this taxon and that many white marks may have a cryptic function. These results extend and contradict those of previous analyses and force us to conclude that contrasting pelage marks have a number of functions in this taxon including pursuit deterrence, intraspecific signaling, and possibly even crypsis.},

abstract = {In 1909, Abbott Thayer suggested that the study of animal coloration lies in the domain of artists because it deals with optical illusions. He proposed, for example, that prey color patterns may obliterate the animal's outline to make the wearer appear invisible to its predators. Despite a long history of research on the neuropsychology of visual illusions in humans, the question of whether they can occur in other animals has remained largely neglected. In this review, we first examine whether the visual effects generated by an animal's shape, coloration, movement, social environment, or direct manipulation of the environment might distort the receiver's perspective to form an illusion. We also consider how illusions fit into the wider conceptual framework of sensory perception and receiver psychology, in order to understand the potential significance of these (and other) visual effects in animal communication. Secondly, we consider traits that manipulate visual processing tasks to intimidate or mislead the viewer. In the third part of the review, we consider the more extreme cases of sensory manipulation, in which individuals or their traits disrupt, overstimulate, or inactivate receivers' sensory systems. Although illusions present just one form of sensory manipulation, we suggest that they are likely to be more common than previously suspected. Furthermore, we expect that research in this area of sensory processing will provide significant insights into the cognitive psychology of animal communication. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.},

@article{Sagot2018,
abstract = {Individuals benefit from socially acquired information to avoid predation risks and enhance foraging efficiency. Spix's disc-winged bats, Thyroptera tricolor, form very stable social groups despite their need to find a new roosting site daily. Thyroptera tricolor produce two contact calls: inquiry calls, emitted during flight, and response calls, produced by bats after finding a suitable roost (in a furled leaf). Bats within social groups exhibit consistent individual differences in vocal behaviour and thus, groups are composed by a mix of less vocal and more vocal individuals. To date, it is not known whether consistent individual differences in contact calling behaviour decrease the time required for roost finding and whether vocal behaviour is correlated with an individual's ability to quickly locate roosts, thus constituting a behavioural syndrome. Here, we compared the time spent by social groups in finding roosts when a bat called from inside the roost, either frequently or infrequently. Moreover, we estimated how well calling rates inside a roost predicted a bat's ability to later find a new roost. Results of behavioural experiments and field observations show that social groups enter roosts faster when the bat inside the roost called more. This suggests that more frequent calling decreases search time, which may allow groupmates to save energy and decrease exposure to predators. Moreover, vocal activity also predicted discovery of more roosts (furled leaves) in their natural habitat, which emphasizes the relevance of more vocal individuals for the group. Our work represents a step in understanding the importance of communication and individual vocal behaviour in group formation and stability in gregarious animals.},

Here, in a novel approach, predator-specific landscapes of fear are constructed on the basis of behavioral responses of a prey species (vervet monkey; Cercopithecus aethiops), and we show how these can be combined with data on resource distribution to account for the observed variation in intensity of space use. Results from a mixed regressive-spatial regressive analysis demonstrate that ranging behavior can indeed be largely interpreted as an adaptive response to perceived risk of pr{\'{e}}dation by some (but not all) predators and the spatial availability of resources. The theoretical framework behind the model is furthermore such that it can easily be extended to incorporate the effects of additional factors potentially shaping animal range use and thus may be of great value to the study of animal spatial ecology. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Female-biased sexual size dimorphism is common in arthropods, apparently driven by fecundity selection in females. Selective pressures that limit growth are less often considered. One factor that researchers have rarely considered is the possible role of energetic limits on growth. The orb weaving spider Nephila clavipes (Linnaeus 1767) is extremely sexually size dimorphic. Males are ''normal'' sized spiders and females are up to ten times longer, having passed through several additional juvenile instars. This extreme size dimorphism presents the opportunity to test for intrinsic energetic costs of gigantism. Prior studies have shown that males successfully reach maturity on a range of diets, while female dietary requirements increase rapidly with increasing size. We here examine the effects of variation in food availability on juvenile female development by randomly assigning spiderlings from six different families (from six distinct populations) to quantitatively varying but qualitatively identical diets. Based upon field observations, we expected that dietary restrictions would have the greatest effect on duration of instars, particularly later instars, and on instar number (because longer total development would lead to curtailment of growth at an earlier stage), with relatively little effect on growth per molt. Because the diets ranged from higher than mean intake observed in the field to well below mean intake, we expected females to mature at a wide range of instars (and sizes). Our results support the functional relationship among food intake, instar duration, and fixed growth per molt (although growth per molt was less canalized than suggested by field observations). However, we observed no variation in number of instars, and we suggest that these data provide additional support for the importance of rare, large prey in the diets of web-building spiders.},

In addition, we tested the adequacy of the current Brazilian protected areas in preserving these species under future climate changes (future distribution for the year 2050), under full and null dispersal scenarios. The final occurrence maps were then confronted with two Brazilian reserve systems for the year 2010: one consisting of reserves for integral protection only (IPCU), and one that included also reserves for sustainable use and indigenous reserves (SUCU). In the IPCU system, none of the species have or will have ≥10{\%} of their distributions protected, under neither dispersal scenario. Including SUCU, however, M. tridactyla and P. maximus already are, and will still be, adequately protected in the future. T. tricinctus, which is endemic to the Brazilian semi-arid, will not reach the 10{\%} goal under neither dispersal scenario, even under the SUCU system. We stress the need for management actions in the northeastern and central parts of Brazil.

abstract = {In social species individuals living in the same group may synchronize activities such as movements, foraging or antipredator vigilance. Synchronization of activities can also be observed between partners especially during breeding and can be crucial for breeding success. Vocalizations are behaviours that can be coordinated between individuals, but simultaneous vocalizations in groups have mostly been considered as noise that does not bear any information. Indeed, little is known about the structure and function of vocal communications involving a network of individuals. How individual vocal activity forms part of the communal sound and how the group influences individual vocal activity are questions that remain to be studied. Zebra finches, Taeniopygia guttata, are social, monogamous songbirds that form lifelong pair bonds. In the wild, they are typically found in small groups, with the pair as the primary social unit, and they gather in ‘social' trees where both females and males produce vocalizations. Here we investigated in the laboratory the influence of group size and composition on general vocal activity and synchrony, as well as the influence of pair bond and spatial location on the finer characteristics of dyads' vocal interactions. We used a set-up that locked the birds at fixed spatial positions of our choosing to control the proximity network and allowed us to match most of the vocalizations with specific individuals. We used an in-house software suite that automatically detects vocalizations from hours of passive recording. We found that zebra finch groups synchronized their general vocal activity with waves of collective vocalizations, which depended on both the size and the composition of the group. The acoustic network was shaped by pair bonds at different timescales. Birds preferentially vocalized close in time to (synchrony) or directly after (turn taking) their partner when it was present and the nearest neighbour when the partner was not available.},

abstract = {Music and dance are universal across human culture and have an ancient history. One characteristic of music is its strong influence on movement. For example, an auditory beat induces rhythmic movement with positive emotions in humans from early developmental stages. In this study, we investigated if sound induced spontaneous rhythmic movement in chimpanzees. Three experiments showed that: 1) an auditory beat induced rhythmic swaying and other rhythmic movements, with larger responses from male chimpanzees than female chimpanzees; 2) random beat as well as regular beat induced rhythmic swaying and beat tempo affected movement periodicity in a chimpanzee in a bipedal posture; and 3) a chimpanzee showed close proximity to the sound source while hearing auditory stimuli. The finding that male chimpanzees showed a larger response to sound than female chimpanzees was consistent with previous literature about "rain dances" in the wild, where male chimpanzees engage in rhythmic displays when hearing the sound of rain starting. The fact that rhythmic swaying was induced regardless of beat regularity may be a critical difference from humans, and a further study should reveal the physiological properties of sound that induce rhythmic movements in chimpanzees. These results suggest some biological foundation for dancing existed in the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees ∼6 million years ago. As such, this study supports the evolutionary origins of musicality.},

All spiders searched for larders removed from their web, and spiders that lost largerlarders (i.e., consisting of more prey items) searched for longer intervals. We thus suggest that N. clavipes form memories of the size of the larders they have accumulated, and that they use those memories to regulate recovery efforts when the larders are pilfered. The content of those memories may include discrete prey counts or the accumulation of a continuous variable correlated with counts, such as the total mass of captured prey.

abstract = {Background: Management of the axilla in breast cancer patients has evolved from routine axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for all patients to a highly selective approach based on the assessment of the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) as well as tumor and patient characteristics. Although ALND continues to have an important role in staging and regional control for many breast cancer patients, recent trial results question the need for routine ALND in patients who have positive SLNs. Methods: Not all axillary disease becomes clinically detectable or relevant with respect to recurrence and survival. Therefore, recent trends indicate that many surgeons have omitted ALND in subgroups of patients, particularly those with clinically node-negative, SLN-positive, early-stage breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving therapy with postoperative irradiation. This review explores trends in axillary management, focusing primarily on the clinical implications of the results from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 randomized controlled trial. Results: According to the results of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, the use of SLN dissection alone did not result in inferior survival compared with ALND in patients with limited SLN disease treated with breast-conserving therapy. This subgroup of women was spared the morbidity associated with ALND. However, several points of debate, including the smaller than anticipated sample size, the older study population, and the length of follow-up, suggest caution when applying these findings to all women with breast cancer. Conclusions: Although the findings of ACOSOG Z0011 are impressive, in clinical practice they are applicable to a limited number of women with breast cancer: those with T1-2 primary tumors with clinically negative axilla and 1 to 2 positive SLNs undergoing breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant whole-breast irradiation. The next generation of clinical trials may answer some of the remaining questions regarding how best to manage the axilla in additional subsets of patients undergoing treatment of breast cancer.},

Whereas migration is a behavioral strategy used by many taxa, it may not be an option for small mammals. However, small mammals can seasonally vary the area of habitat in which they are active. The striped mouse Rhabdomys pumilio in the semiarid Succulent Karoo of South Africa lives in a seasonal environment, characterized by hot, dry summers with low food abundance and cold, wet winters, followed by high food abundance in spring. We radio tracked a total of 28 females during the 2004 dry season, the following breeding season in spring, and the following dry season in 2005 and tested the prediction that females shift their home ranges in relation to food availability. Females shifted their home ranges from an area characterized by evergreen succulent shrubs in the vicinity of a dry riverbed in the dry season to sandy areas that were characterized by new plant growth of annuals in spring. Home ranges during the breeding season in spring had a higher percentage of annuals than dry season home ranges measured in spring. Female home range size increased during the breeding season. We suggest that female striped mice shift their home ranges seasonally to gain access to protein-rich young plant material, which is important for breeding. {\textcopyright} The Author 2006.

abstract = {Territoriality is central to animal behaviourists' understanding of many facets of animal behaviour, including resource acquisition, space use behaviour, communication and mating systems. However, the term itself, how it is conceptualized and defined, has long been nebulous and contentious. Here, we ask whether juxtaposing debates about territoriality from animal behaviour with parallel discussions of territoriality from the social sciences can offer a historically and sociologically informed path out of the conceptual gridlock in which animal territoriality has been located for decades. We delineate two key problems with territoriality identified in the animal behaviour literature: First, that it focuses on how animals are expected to behave rather than how they actually behave and, second, that it assumes rather than demonstrates the function of, and specific relationships among, individuals. We then link these problems to social scientists' theorizations of the difference between property and access: whereas property is focused on how people are expected to behave under juridical–legal rules governing resource use, access focuses on a wide array of means by which people actually access resources. We thus argue that longstanding problems with animal territoriality have arisen due to implicitly embedded notions of property and ownership. Our juxtaposition raises two further problems with territoriality: first, it unwarrantedly serves to attribute authority to individuals described as territory ‘owners' and casts others (‘intruders', ‘sneakers') as transgressors and, second, conceiving of ownership is unfeasible in animal societies lacking the particular juridical–legal institutions that establish and enforce property rights. Instead, we advocate for an access-based approach that will obviate these problems. Ultimately, we argue that the theory of access, as developed in social science literatures on spatial and relational resource use, will allow for a fuller and more nuanced understanding of variation in animal behaviour than that afforded by current dominant notions of territoriality.},

abstract = {Space use and ranging patterns of individuals have traditionally been used to identify social systems, and the amount of overlap in the home ranges of individuals can provide indirect information about the likelihood of social interactions. We compared data on foraging and roosting range overlap of the tent-roosting bat Artibeus watsoni to assess how environmental and demographic factors may affect movement patterns and social interactions. We estimated the overlap of foraging and roosting ranges among simultaneously radiotagged dyads and calculated a simple association index among these individuals. We then used these data to determine whether relative population and roost abundance, as well as sex class, affected spatial and social patterns. Our results show that range overlap in A. watsoni significantly determines the degree to which individuals interact with each other. We also found that roosting range overlap may be a greater determinant of daytime social interactions than foraging range overlap, because roosting range overlap showed a stronger correlation with association patterns. In addition, the differences that we observed in roosting range overlap and association among dyads were a consequence of the effects of population and roost density. Bats sampled in areas of high-population abundance had significantly higher roosting range overlap than bats in areas of low-population abundance, and roosting ranges of bats sampled at sites with few roosting resources (i.e. tents) overlapped more than those of bats living in areas with more tents. Finally, we observed no overlap in roosting range and no association among adult males, supporting the hypothesis that males defend tents or roosting areas against other males to gain exclusive mating access to females using these structures. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

We directly observed coyotes (Canis latrans) in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming to produce home range estimates using the harmonic mean, adaptive kernel, and minimum convex polygon methods. We compared estimated home ranges of 8 coyotes to their observed territories for 2 packs during 3 years of observation. Based on analysis of individual coyotes, the 94{\%}, 93{\%}, and 96{\%} contours best fit territorial delineation for the adaptive kernel, harmonic mean, and minimum convex polygon estimators, respectively. All estimators were able to fit home range contours to an actual territory, but differences in home range fit were apparent. Using analyses based on packs, the 94{\%}, 94{\%}, and 96{\%} contours best fit the territorial boundaries for the adaptive kernel, harmonic mean, and minimum convex polygon estimators, respectively. Our inferences to other species and radiotelemetry data are limited, and we encourage further biological testing of mathematically devised behavioral measures. Because the minimum convex polygon best fit territorial boundaries in 4 out of 5 territorial observations, and because of its intuitive simplicity, we suggest that the 96{\%} minimum convex polygon may be most appropriate to describe coyote home ranges relative to territory in similar studies.},

abstract = {It is widely assumed that aggressive behavior affects space acquisition in territorial species, but to date most workers have focused on competition for indivisible space, that is, space that cannot be divided or shared. We present a learning-based model that investigates the effects of aggressive interactions on space acquisition when unequal competitors arrive and settle in patches of divisible space. This model assumes that aggressive interactions act as punishment, in the sense that previous aggressive interactions in a given area reduce an individual's likelihood of returning to that area. Individually based, spatially explicit simulations incorporating this and other assumptions were used to investigate the effects of different types of aggressive interactions on the space use of individuals and dyads settling in divisible space. At the individual level, final space use was related to the amount of punishment that individuals inflicted on their opponents during aggressive interactions; in general, highly aggressive individuals acquired larger, more exclusive home ranges than less aggressive individuals. At the dyadic level, the division or sharing of space between competitors depended on both the relative and absolute punishment that competitors inflicted on one another during aggressive interactions. Aggressive interactions in which both participants strongly punished one another (e.g., escalated fights) produced mutually exclusive home ranges, interactions with intermediate levels of punishment produced asymmetrical space use patterns proportional to asymmetries in punishment levels, and interactions involving little punishment for either participant generated large home ranges with extensive home range overlap. Overall, our model implies that territorial animals need not "win" aggressive interactions to win divisible space, that repeatedly "nagging" an opponent may also be a viable strategy for gaining space, and that a learning-based approach can account for puzzling patterns in the territorial literature, for example, observations of individuals who acquire space by initiating aggressive interactions that they never win.},

abstract = {Information about the spatial distribution of individual foraging habitats, which determines the space required by a population to be viable, is vitally important for the conservation of bats. Detailed knowledge of this kind is crucial for the design of nature reserves and management plans. Recent field studies that examined habitat use and home range distribution of bats largely ignored factors like traditional range use vs. intra- and interspecific competition, which may be responsible for the spatial organisation of a population home range. We investigated the home range sizes and distribution of a maternity colony of the western barbastelle bat via radio telemetry in four consecutive tracking sessions (2004-2007). Based on 19 data sets with a total of 2737 fixes obtained from 12 females, we examined (i) how colony members partition the population home range (home range overlap analysis), and (ii) if individuals tracked over several years exhibit site fidelity. Home range sizes ranged from 125 to 2551 ha (median: 403 ha), with a median number of 2 core areas (range: 1-5 core areas per individual per year). The core area sizes ranged from 5 to 285 ha (median: 67 ha). A home range and core area overlap analysis showed that site fidelity across years seems to be more important for home range distribution than competition among colony members. This allows researchers to combine information from several years to get a deeper insight into the population's spatial requirements. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Specialist animals are at a greater risk of extinction in the face of environmental change than generalist ones. The inability of some specialist taxa to expand host range through evolution may exacerbate or cause their high extinction risk. Here we use connectionism (a framework for modelling animal behaviour) to predict the environmental and physiological factors that predispose some specialist taxa to an ‘evolutionary dead-end'. Neural networks are evolved to become resource-specialised in a resource-abundant and resource-diverse ‘historical' environment while losing ‘genes' that should restrict their ability to expand their host range. Networks are subsequently challenged to escape their dead-end by expanding host range in a ‘contemporary' environment that may have depleted resource abundance and diversity (as many human impacted environments do). Loss of diversity in available resources universally constrains the ability of networks to expand host range and this effect is very robust to network conformation. Environmental resource abundance is more variable in its effect. Networks are generally robust to loss of genetic diversity during the evolution of specialisation except at very high rates of loss. By omitting historical specialisation, we show that the effect of resource diversity on host range expansion is not a universal network property but something that is often specific to specialist organisms. Historical specialisation also slightly reduces the robustness of networks in the contemporary environment to loss of genetic diversity during the specialisation process. Fundamentally, simulations predict that loss of local resource diversity will further increase the vulnerability of specialists to extinction by constraining their ability to expand host range in the face of environmental change.},

abstract = {Interactions with conspecifics are an important aspect of an individual's environment. Although it is well known that the presence of conspecifics can have important effects on behaviour, in general it is also now acknowledged that the composition of the social environment can vary, and that this variation may have profound effects on individual behaviour and fitness. Using a wild population of North American red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, we investigated the importance of the composition of the social environment in a territorial species by assessing whether the risk of intrusion faced by territory owners varied with the degree of relatedness and familiarity in their social neighbourhoods. To test this, we conducted temporary removals of territory owners and observed the time until intrusion and the identity of intruding individuals. We found that individuals in neighbourhoods with low average familiarity faced a higher risk of intrusion and that unfamiliar neighbours were more likely to intrude. Surprisingly, we found that related neighbours also posed a higher risk of intrusion. The results from our study suggest that familiarity with neighbours may be an ecologically and evolutionarily relevant measure of the social environment, even in a species considered to be ‘asocial'. Future studies should consider the potential importance of the social environment, which has heretofore been mostly overlooked, as a relevant selective pressure in asocial, territorial species.},

abstract = {Inhibitory control is the ability to resist performing a prepotent, but ultimately incorrect, behaviour in situations that demand restraint. Inhibitory control is linked to brain size and intelligence in humans and animals, but it is unclear just how it evolves. Inhibitory control is thought to be particularly important in complex social environments where demands can shift frequently based on the social context and the identities or behaviours of other individuals in a group. Indeed, the social intelligence hypothesis suggests that the demands of living in complex social groups led to the evolution of sophisticated cognition. Here, we tested inhibitory control in wild spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, whose large social groups are structured by linear dominance hierarchies. We tested inhibitory control using the cylinder test, which requires subjects to inhibit going straight for a food reward. In support of our predictions, hyaenas living in larger groups had greater inhibitory control. In particular, the size of the cohort in which young hyaenas grew up, rather than the size of adult groups, had the strongest effect. In addition, the effect of group size was significantly stronger for low-ranking hyaenas, which must frequently inhibit both feeding and aggression in the presence of higher-ranking hyaenas. Contrary to our predictions, adult male hyaenas, which always occupy very low rank positions as adults, did not have better inhibitory control than adult females.

abstract = {Human activities have negatively impacted many species, particularly those with unique traits that restrict their use of resources and conditions to specific habitats. Unfortunately, few studies have been able to isolate the individual and combined effects of different threats on population persistence in a natural setting, since not all organisms can be associated with discrete habitat features occurring over limited spatial scales. We present the results of a field study that examines the short-term effects of roost loss in a specialist bat using a conspicuous, easily modified resource. We mimicked roost loss in the natural habitat and monitored individuals before and after the perturbation to determine patterns of resource use, spatial movements, and group stability. Our study focused on the disc-winged bat Thyroptera tricolor, a species highly morphologically specialized for roosting in the developing furled leaves of members of the order Zingiberales. We found that the number of species used for roosting increased, that home range size increased (before: mean 0.14±SD 0.08 ha; after: 0.73±0.68 ha), and that mean association indices decreased (before: 0.95±0.10; after: 0.77±0.18) once the roosting habitat was removed. These results demonstrate that the removal of roosting resources is associated with a decrease in roost-site preferences or selectivity, an increase in mobility of individuals, and a decrease in social cohesion. These responses may reduce fitness by potentially increasing energetic expenditure, predator exposure, and a decrease in cooperative interactions. Despite these potential risks, individuals never used roost-sites other than developing furled leaves, suggesting an extreme specialization that could ultimately jeopardize the long-term persistence of this species' local populations.},

The advantages of mixed-species groups include improved information transfer, dilution of predation risk, and social thermoregulation. We hypothesized that interspecific associations may be facilitated by the development of heterospecific "social" preferences. We manipulated the early social environment of captive Kuhl's pipistrelles (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and Savi's bats (Hypsugo savii), raising newborns in artificial mixed-species groups to simulate conditions in natural mixed-species nurseries. We then measured association patterns among all bats and analyzed the occurrence of social interactions by behavioral observation protocols and social network analyses. Bats preferentially interacted and affiliated with former group members regardless of species, showing that social bonding may occur between different species and that it develops after close contact with newborn heterospecifics, possibly through imprinting-like mechanisms. To our best knowledge, this is the first time such a phenomenon is documented for mammals. Although thermal preferences are often advocated to explain mixed-species associations among bats, individual experience may facilitate heterospecific groups in bats and other taxa.},

abstract = {Habitat complexity can mediate key processes that structure local assemblages through effects on factors such as competition, predation and foraging behaviour. While most studies address assemblage responses to habitat complexity within one locality, a more global approach allows conclusions with greater independence from the phylogenetic constraints of the target assemblages, thus allowing greater generality. We tested the effects of natural and manipulated habitat complexities on ant assemblages from South Africa, Australia and Sweden, in order to determine if there were globally consistent responses in how functional measures of foraging success are regulated by habitat complexity. Specifically, we considered how habitat complexity affected ant foraging rates including the speed of discovery and rate of monopolisation. We also tested if habitat complexity affected the body size index, a size-related morphological trait, of ants discovering resources and occupying and monopolising the resources after 180 min. Ants were significantly slower to discover baits in the more complex treatments, consistent with predictions that they would move more slowly through more complex environments. The monopolisation index was also lower in the more complex treatments, suggesting that resources were more difficult to defend. Our index of ant body size showed trends in the predicted direction for complexity treatments. In addition, ants discovering, occupying and monopolising resources were smaller in simple than in complex natural habitats. Responses of discovering ants to resources in natural habitats were clear in only one of three regions. Consistent with our predictions, habitat complexity thus affected functional measures of the foraging success of ants in terms of measures of discovery and monopolisation rates and body size traits of successful ants. However, patterns were not always equally clear in manipulative and mensurative components of the study. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Aim: Amazonia and Atlantic Rain Forests share a common biogeographical origin and have an interconnected history that includes the drier biomes between them. It is not clear if the establishment of the South American Dry Diagonal promoted isolation between these forests or if connections between them have occurred after this event. We sought to investigate biotic diversification and geographical evolution in these biomes with a phylogeographical study of Nephila clavipes, a rain forest dwelling spider. Location: South America. Methods: We collected 320 individuals from 49 sites and sequenced one mitochondrial and two nuclear DNA regions. We analysed the genetic diversity, structure and demography, did phylogenetic inferences, estimated divergence times, inferred ancestral areas and applied a model-based approach to test competitive hypotheses on the species' evolution. Results: An ancient split, coincident with the Central Cordillera final uplift, segregated a Trans-Andean Colombian lineage from the others. Four lineages occur in Brazil, with a Pleistocene divergence: one in Amazonia, one in the northern and southern Atlantic Forest and two associated with the Dry Diagonal, but also reaching the Southern Atlantic Forest and Amazonia. The biogeographical analysis indicated that some lineages have expanded their ranges along the Pleistocene. Main conclusions: Pleistocene connections of Amazonia and Atlantic rain forests through the central part of the Cerrado were supported. No phylogeographical break was detected along the Atlantic Forest. Geological and climatic events contributed to lineage diversification in N. clavipes. Studying widely distributed species is primary in unveiling evolutionary patterns in highly complex regions.},

abstract = {The future of mammalian diversity in the tropics depends largely on the conservation value of human-dominated lands. We investigated the distribution of non-flying mammals in five habitats of southern Costa Rica: relatively extensive forest (227 ha), coffee plantation, pasture, coffee with adjacent forest remnant ({\textless}35 ha), and pasture with adjacent forest remnant ({\textless}35 ha). Of the 26 native species recorded in our study plots, 9 (35{\%}) were restricted to forest habitat, 14 (54{\%}) occurred in both forest and agricultural habitats, and 3 (11{\%}) were found only in agricultural habitats. Species richness and composition varied significantly with habitat type but not with distance from the extensive forest. Interestingly, small forest remnants ({\textless}35 ha) contiguous with coffee plantations did not differ from more extensive forest in species richness and were richer than other agricultural habitat types. Small remnants contiguous with pasture were species-poor. When clearing started, the study region likely supported about 60 species. Since then, at least 6 species (10{\%}), one family (4{\%}), and one order (11{\%}) have gone extinct locally. The species that disappeared were the largest in their families and included carnivorous (e.g., jaguar [Panthera onca]), herbivorous (e.g., Baird's tapir, [Tapirus bairdii]), and arboreal (e.g., mantled howler monkey [Alouatta palliata]) species. Although there is no substitute for native forest habitat, the majority of native, nonflying mammal species use countryside habitats. The populations of many persist even {\textgreater} 5 km from relatively extensive forest, at least over the 40 years since forest clearance. Moreover, if hunting ceased, we expect that at least one of the locally extinct species could be reestablished in the existing landscape. Thus, there is an important opportunity to maintain and restore the diversity, abundance, and ecosystem roles of mammals in at least some human-dominated regions of the Neotropics.},

abstract = {The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) forms a critical switch in the production of orange/red pheomelanin and black/brown eumelanin pigments during hair development in mammals. The molecular evolution of the melanocortin-1 receptor gene was investigated in a broad range of primate species, including several groups with large differences in distribution of orange/red and black hairs. Primate MC1R has been subject to purifying selection throughout most of its evolution, with small changes in selective constraint being detected early in primate evolution. In contrast to the situation in humans and domestic mammals, many intraspecific and intrageneric differences in primate coat color cannot be attributed to changes in the MC1R coding sequence. Nevertheless, important changes in the biochemical function of MC1R are suggested by mutations in sites of known functional importance, particularly in New World monkeys and lemurs. The evolution of the MC1R in lion tamarins is anomalous, with a combination of a high nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS) ratio, deletions, and substitutions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {The tempo of species diversification in large clades can reveal fundamental evolutionary mechanisms that operate on large temporal and spatial scales [1-4]. Hummingbirds have radiated into a diverse assemblage of specialized nectarivores comprising 338 species, but their evolutionary history has not, until now, been comprehensively explored. We studied hummingbird diversification by estimating a time-calibrated phylogeny for 284 hummingbird species, demonstrating that hummingbirds invaded South America by ∼22 million years ago, and subsequently diversified into nine principal clades (see [5-7]). Using ancestral state reconstruction and diversification analyses, we (1) estimate the age of the crown-group hummingbird assemblage, (2) investigate the timing and patterns of lineage accumulation for hummingbirds overall and regionally, and (3) evaluate the role of Andean uplift in hummingbird speciation. Detailed analyses reveal disparate clade-specific processes that allowed for ongoing species diversification. One factor was significant variation among clades in diversification rates. For example, the nine principal clades of hummingbirds exhibit ∼15-fold variation in net diversification rates, with evidence for accelerated speciation of a clade that includes the Bee, Emerald, and Mountain Gem groups of hummingbirds. A second factor was colonization of key geographic regions, which opened up new ecological niches. For example, some clades diversified in the context of the uplift of the Andes Mountains, whereas others were affected by the formation of the Panamanian land bridge. Finally, although species accumulation is slowing in all groups of hummingbirds, several major clades maintain rapid rates of diversification on par with classical examples of rapid adaptive radiation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Species should only persist in local communities if they have functional traits that are compatible with habitat-specific environmental conditions. Consequently, pronounced regional environmental gradients should produce environmental filtering, or a trait-based spatial segregation of species. It is critical to quantify the links between species' functional traits and their environment in order to reveal the relative importance of this process to community assembly and promote understanding of the impacts of ongoing environmental changes. We investigated this relationship using epigaeic ants in an environmentally heterogeneous region of Florida. We found evidence for environmental filtering as environmental conditions such as groundcover, surface temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and plant diversity were strongly correlated with assemblage composition. Certain species traits appeared particularly important to persistence: (1) ants in environments with less groundcover have relatively longer legs but do not differ in size, (2) ants in hotter environments exhibit greater thermal tolerances, and (3) ants in hotter and drier environments do not exhibit greater desiccation resistance. These findings show surface complexity and temperature may interact with morphology and physiology to impact the spatial distribution of ants and underscore the importance of climate change. Climate warming is predicted to alter assemblage composition, competitive dynamics, and consequently impact ecosystem processes. We suggest environmental filters acting at regional scales, as shown here, act in tandem with more frequently studied local-scale competitive interactions to delimit ant community assemblages. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Mammalian fur often shows agouti banding with a proximal dark band near the skin and a lighter distal band. We examined the function of both bands in relation to camouflage, thermal properties of pelts, and thermal energetics of dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata), which are known to use torpor and basking. Although the distal band of dunnart fur darkened with increasing latitude, which is important for camouflage, it did not affect the thermal properties and the length of the dark band and total hair length were not correlated. In contrast, the length of the proximal dark band of preserved pelts exposed to sunlight was positively correlated (r2 = 0.59) with the temperature underneath the pelt (Tpelt). All dunnarts offered radiant heat basked by exposing the dark band of the hair during both rest and torpor. Basking dunnarts with longer dark bands had lower resting metabolism (r2 = 0.69), warmed faster from torpor (r2 = 0.77), required less energy to do so (r2 = 0.32), and reached a higher subcutaneous temperature (Tsub) at the end of rewarming (r2 = 0.75). We provide the first experimental evidence on the possible dual function of the color banding of mammalian fur. The distal colored band appears to be important for camouflage, whereas the length of the dark proximal hair band facilitates heat gain for energy conservation and allows animals to rewarm quickly and economically from torpor.},

abstract = {Specialization is a concept based on a broad theoretical framework developed by evolutionary biologists and ecologists. In the past 10 years, numerous studies have reported that - in many contexts - generalist species are "replacing" specialist species. We review recent research on the concept of the ecological niche and species specialization, and conclude that (1) the observed worldwide decline in specialist species is predicted by niche theory, (2) specialist declines cause "functional homogenization" of biodiversity, and (3) such homogenization may be used to measure the impact of disturbance on communities. Homogenization at the community level could alter ecosystem functioning and productivity, as well as result in the deterioration of ecosystem goods and services. We propose community-level specialization as an indicator of the impact of global changes (habitat and climate disturbances) on biodiversity. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

This paper addresses recent developments in the study of both intra- and inter-individual variation. After reviewing several methods (e.g., intraclass correlation, product-moment correlation, and confirmatory factor analysis) for quantifying intra-individual consistency or repeatability, we discuss how these measures of repeatability can serve as guides for appropriately defining traits and how they may be helpful in ensuring that appropriate statistical models are used (e.g., in accounting for measurement errors in regression analyses). We discuss three aspects of inter-individual variation; phenotypic selection, alternative individual strategies and phenotypic integration, and quantitative genetic analyses. The value of these approaches for studying inter-individual variation is illustrated with recent examples from the literature. Finally, we discuss how many field studies of mammals may be well poised to exploit the unique insights that can be gained from studying individual variation.},

abstract = {Prey catching behavior in most spiders is dominated by vibratory signals generated by prey animals. We have studied the release of the predatory behavior in two orb weavers, Zygiella x-notata and Nephila clavipes (Araneidae) and measured threshold curves by applying sinusoidal stimuli to the webs (Fig. 1). 1. Resting position: While Zygiella mostly stays in its retreat with one or both of its 1st legs on the end of the signal thread, Nephila sits in the hub of its orb web with its prosoma pointing downward (Figs. 2, 3). 2. Reaction: When stimulated by web vibrations the spiders show different behaviors ranging from weak movement of one leg to turning and then running toward the stimulus. The shortest latency time was 0.1 s for both spiders (video-analysis). The time for the turn toward the vibration source was 0.6 s for Zygiella (upon arrival in hub) and 0.04 s for Nephila. The resulting "error angles" measured 3.6 ° (±7.7 S.D.) for Zygiella and 7.0 ° (±8.2 S.D.) for Nephila (Fig. 5). 3. Airborne vibrations: A fly buzzing in the air above the spider rarely elicits elements of predatory behavior in Nephila or Zygiella. Instead, the spiders often lift their forelegs in this situation (Fig. 6b) displaying a defensive response never shown with web-borne vibrations. The threshold displacements of the web necessary to elicit predatory behavior did not change after ablation of all trichobothria (Zygiella). 4. Transverse sinusoidal vibrations: Stimuli were applied 6 cm away from the nearest leg of the spider to the signal thread (Zygiella) or radius (Nephila). Zygiella: The threshold displacement necessary to elicit predatory behavior is high at low frequencies (10 Hz, 61.3 dB) and steadily decreases toward high frequencies (1000 Hz, 12.9 dB) (0 dB = 1 $\mu$m). When keeping the displacement constant, the percentage of reactions increases considerably with stimulus frequency. Nephila: Unlike our finding in Zygiella the threshold curve shows a minimum between 280 Hz and 420 Hz (30 Hz, 57.1 dB; 420 Hz, 24.2 dB). When using constant stimulus displacement the percentage of reactions is highest in the same frequency range (Figs. 7, 8). 5. Longitudinal vibrations: The threshold displacement needed to elicit predatory behavior of Zygiella is 3-4 dB lower for predominantly longitudinal vibrations than for transverse vibrations of the signal thread. The number of spiders reacting more than doubles both at low (160 Hz) and high frequencies (730 Hz) by using longitudinal instead of transverse stimulation at constant displacement (Fig. 8). 6. Active localization:Zygiella and Nephila actively locate objects hanging motionless in their webs by vibrating the radii with their forelegs. Zygiella detected a 0.4 mg particle 6 cm away from the hub in 75 {\%} of the cases and in one case even found a 0.05 mg particle. The information used by the spider is not derived from the thread tension itself but most likely from a change in the vibratory echo. {\textcopyright} 1982 Springer-Verlag.},

Mechanisms underlying spatial segregation have their roots in the characteristics of the animals, their mutual interaction and their response, collective as well as individual, to environmental variables. This review describes how the combination of these factors shapes the patterns we observe and presents a practical, usable framework for the analysis of movement data in confined spaces. The basis of the framework is the theory of interacting random walks and the mathematical description of out-of-equilibrium systems. Although our focus is on modelling and interpreting animal home ranges and territories in vertebrates, we believe further studies on invertebrates may also help to answer questions and resolve unanswered puzzles that are still inaccessible to experimental investigation in vertebrate species.},

abstract = {Animal integumentary coloration plays a crucial role in visual communication and camouflage, and varies extensively among and within species and populations. To understand the pressures underlying such diversity, it is essential to elucidate the mechanisms by which animals have created novel integumentary coloration. Colours can be produced by selective absorption of light by skin pigments, through light scattering by structured or unstructured tissues, or by a combination of pigments and nanostructures. In this review, we highlight our current understanding of the interactions between pigments and structural integumentary tissues and molecules. We analyse the available evidence suggesting that these combined mechanisms are capable of creating colours and optical properties unachievable by either mechanism alone, thereby effectively expanding the animal colour palette. Moreover, structural and pigmentary colour mechanisms frequently interact in unexpected and overlooked ways, suggesting that classification of colours as being of any particular type may be difficult. Finally, we discuss how these mixtures are useful for investigating the largely unknown genetic, developmental and physical processes generating phenotypic diversity. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Animal coloration: production, perception, function and application'.},

abstract = {An individual's home range determines its access to resources, significantly influencing its fitness. Food availability and population density are considered to be among the primary factors influencing home range sizes; however, no study has experimentally tested whether these two factors affect home range sizes independently. This is important as these two factors correlate significantly with each other, making it difficult to differentiate the effect of one from the other. First, we supplemented food to 23 female African striped mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, belonging to 15 different groups. To avoid an increase in population density by immigration, we also provided food to neighbouring groups. Although population density did not increase, female home range sizes decreased by 43.1{\%}. In a second experiment, we manipulated population density by removing entire social groups of striped mice. We carried out experiments within 7 weeks, a period short enough to control for a change in natural food availability. Experimental decrease of population density caused an increase of female home range sizes of 44.3{\%}. The degree of home range overlap between female striped mice was unaffected by supplemental feeding or by reduction of population density. However, female home range sizes were negatively affected by the total number of female neighbours, especially of heavier individuals. In addition, after removal, females significantly decreased their overlap with neighbouring breeding females indicating that competition with same-sex individuals shapes females' home ranges. This is the first comprehensive experimental field study demonstrating that an increase in food availability and a decrease in population density independently affect home range sizes of individuals.},

abstract = {Mammalian colour patterns are among the most recognizable characteristics found in nature and can have a profound impact on fitness. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the formation and subsequent evolution of these patterns. Here we show that, in the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio), periodic dorsal stripes result from underlying differences in melanocyte maturation, which give rise to spatial variation in hair colour. We identify the transcription factor ALX3 as a regulator of this process. In embryonic dorsal skin, patterned expression of Alx3 precedes pigment stripes and acts to directly repress Mitf, a master regulator of melanocyte differentiation, thereby giving rise to light-coloured hair. Moreover, Alx3 is upregulated in the light stripes of chipmunks, which have independently evolved a similar dorsal pattern. Our results show a previously undescribed mechanism for modulating spatial variation in hair colour and provide insights into how phenotypic novelty evolves.},

abstract = {Thraupidae is the second largest family of birds and represents about 4{\%} of all avian species and 12{\%} of the Neotropical avifauna. Species in this family display a wide range of plumage colors and patterns, foraging behaviors, vocalizations, ecotypes, and habitat preferences. The lack of a complete phylogeny for tanagers has hindered the study of this evolutionary diversity. Here, we present a comprehensive, species-level phylogeny for tanagers using six molecular markers. Our analyses identified 13 major clades of tanagers that we designate as subfamilies. In addition, two species are recognized as distinct branches on the tanager tree. Our topologies disagree in many places with previous estimates of relationships within tanagers, and many long-recognized genera are not monophyletic in our analyses. Our trees identify several cases of convergent evolution in plumage ornaments and bill morphology, and two cases of social mimicry. The phylogeny produced by this study provides a robust framework for studying macroevolutionary patterns and character evolution. We use our new phylogeny to study diversification processes, and find that tanagers show a background model of exponentially declining diversification rates. Thus, the evolution of tanagers began with an initial burst of diversification followed by a rate slowdown. In addition to this background model, two later, clade-specific rate shifts are supported, one increase for Darwin's finches and another increase for some species of Sporophila. The rate of diversification within these two groups is exceptional, even when compared to the overall rapid rate of diversification found within tanagers. This study provides the first robust assessment of diversification rates for the Darwin's finches in the context of the larger group within which they evolved. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Home range size characterizes the interplay between an organism and its environment. Determinants of home range size can be intrinsic or extrinsic to the individual but all factors relate along a hierarchical pattern according to spatial and temporal scale. Determinants of home range size at species and population levels result from relatively slow processes, such as evolutionary changes in body size or global changes in climate. Range determinants at the lower level of individuals, however, can change at a relatively fast rate as they result from more rapid processes, such as the seasonal production of food or annual changes in predation rates. Not only do higher scales constrain those below but also lower level processes combine to affect higher scales. Further, correlates of home range size can differ among scales. To incorporate the possible findings of different patterns at different temporal and spatial scales we recommend using a comparative approach to complement controlled manipulative experiments.},

A generalized view on the evolution of territoriality is accordingly still missing. In this review, we show that territorial conflicts can be classified into qualitatively distinct types according to what mode of access to a territory which competitor attempts to gain. We argue that many of the inconsistencies between existing studies can be traced back to the fact that, while using the same terminology, different instances of these types of conflicts have been investigated. We discuss the connections of each type of conflict to existing research within the wider area of animal conflicts. We conclude that a clear conceptual separation of different types of territorial conflicts is helpful but that a more general theory of territoriality has to account for interdependencies between them and that a more mechanistic approach to modelling territoriality is needed.},

We evaluated whether taxonomic richness (TR) is informative in terms of ecological diversity (ED, an approximation to functional diversity) and phylogenetic diversity (AvPD) using data on 531 mammal species representing South American old autochthonous (marsupials, xenarthrans), mid-Cenozoic immigrants (hystricognaths, primates) and newcomers (carnivorans, artiodactyls). If closely related species are ecologically more similar than distantly related species, AvPD will be a strong predictor of ED; however, lower ED than predicted from AvPD may be due to species retaining most of their ancestral characters, suggesting niche conservatism. This pattern could occur in tropical rainforests for taxa of tropical affinity (old autochthonous and mid-Cenozoic immigrants) and in open and arid habitats for newcomers. In contrast, higher ED than expected from AvPD could occur, possibly in association with niche evolution, in arid and open habitats for taxa of tropical affinity and in forested habitats for newcomers. We found that TR was a poor predictor of ED and AvPD. After controlling for TR, there was considerable variability in the extent to which AvPD accounted for ED. Taxa of tropical affinity did not support the prediction of ED deficit within tropical rainforests, rather, they showed a mosaic of regions with an excess of ED interspersed with zones of ED deficit within the tropics; newcomers showed ED deficit in arid and open regions. Some taxa of tropical affinity showed excess of ED in tropical desert areas (hystricognaths) or temperate semideserts (xenarthrans); newcomers showed excess of ED at cold-temperate latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. This result suggests that extreme climatic conditions at both temperate and tropical latitudes may have promoted niche evolution in mammals.},

abstract = {In social species that cooperatively defend territories the decision to retreat or attack in contests between groups is likely to depend on ecological and social factors. Previous studies have emphasized the importance of the encounter location or the size of competing groups on the outcome. In addition, the identity of the intruder, whether familiar or stranger, may also play a role. To test whether the same factors affect the resident group's decisions already at the beginning of contests, we simulated intergroup encounters in banded mongooses (Mungos mungo). When spotting rival groups banded mongooses emit "screeching calls" which lead group members to bunch up. With playbacks of these calls, we tested how the groups' response was affected by the following factors: 1) the location of the playback in relation to their territory (exclusive use vs. overlap); 2) the number of resident individuals; and 3) the origin of calls (neighbor vs. stranger) used. Subjects were more likely to approach the loudspeakers and arrive within 1 m of the speakers in the exclusive use zone than in the overlap zone. Moreover, larger groups tended to be more likely to move toward the loudspeakers and were also more likely to arrive there. The origin of calls used in the playbacks did not affect the groups' responses. These findings exemplify the importance of the combined effect of location and group size on group decisions during impending intergroup contest. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.},

They cause damage on human, livestock, agricultural crops, building, and infrastructure. They also cause airplane strike, disease transmission, and contamination, and bite humans during self-defense. Bat populations appear to be declining presumably in response to human induced environmental stresses like habitat destruction and fragmentation, disturbance to caves, depletion of food resources, overhunting for bush meat and persecution, increased use of pesticides, infectious disease, and wind energy turbine.

abstract = {Social network analysis provides a broad and complex perspective on animal sociality that is widely applicable to almost any species. Recent applications demonstrate the utility of network analysis for advancing our understanding of the dynamics, selection pressures, development, and evolution of complex social systems. However, most studies of animal social networks rely primarily on a descriptive approach. To propel the field of animal social networks beyond exploratory analyses and to facilitate the integration of quantitative methods that allow for the testing of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant hypotheses, we review methodological and conceptual advances in network science, which are underutilized in studies of animal sociality. First, we highlight how the use of statistical modeling and triadic motifs analysis can advance our understanding of the processes that structure networks. Second, we discuss how the consideration of temporal changes and spatial constraints can shed light on the dynamics of social networks. Third, we consider how the study of variation at multiple scales can potentially transform our understanding of the structure and function of animal networks. We direct readers to analytical tools that facilitate the adoption of these new concepts and methods. Our goal is to provide behavioral ecologists with a toolbox of current methods that can stimulate novel insights into the ecological influences and evolutionary pressures structuring networks and advance our understanding of the proximate and ultimate processes that drive animal sociality. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

abstract = {Neural crest-derived melanoblasts are the progenitors of melanocytes, the pigment cells of the skin, hair and choroid. Previous studies of adult chimaeric mice carrying different coat colour markers have suggested that the total melanocyte population is derived from a small number of melanoblast progenitors, each of which generates a discrete unilateral transverse band of colour. This work also suggested minimal mixing of cells between clones. We have used two complementary approaches to assess the behaviour of migrating clones of melanoblasts directly in the developing embryo. First, we made aggregation chimaeras between transgenic Dct-lacZ and non-transgenic embryos, in which lacZ is a marker for melanoblasts. Second, we generated transgenic mice carrying a modified lacZ reporter construct containing a 289 base pair duplication (laacZ) under the control of the Dct promoter. The laacZ transgene is normally inactive, but reverts to wild-type lacZ at low frequency, labelling a cell and all of its progeny at random. Mosaic embryos containing labelled melanoblast clones were generated. In contrast to previous data, chimaeric and mosaic embryonic melanoblast patterns suggest that: (1) there is a large number of melanoblast progenitors; (2) there is a pool of melanoblasts in the cervical region; (3) different cell dispersion mechanisms may operate in the head and trunk regions; and (4) there is extensive axial mixing between clones.},

abstract = {Coloration is one of the most conspicuous traits that varies among organisms. Carotenoid pigments are responsible for many of the red, orange, and yellow colors in the natural world and, at least for most animals, these molecules must be acquired from their environment. Identifying genes important for carotenoid transport, deposition, and processing has been difficult, in contrast to the well-characterized genes involved in the melanogenesis pathways. We review recent progress in the genetics of carotenoid processing, advances owing in part to the application of high-throughput sequencing data. We focus on examples from several classes of genes coding for scavenger receptors, $\beta$-carotene oxygenases, and ketolases. We also review comparative studies that have revealed several important findings in the evolution of these genes. Namely, that they are conserved across deep phylogenetic timescales, are associated with gene/genome duplications, and introgression has contributed to their movement between several taxa.},

abstract = {Animal colours commonly act as signals for mates or predators. In many damselfly species, both sexes go through a developmental colour change as adults, and females often show colour polymorphism, which may have a function in mate choice, avoidance of mating harassment and camouflage. In the blue-tailed damselfly, Ischnura elegans, young males are bright green and turn blue as they reach maturity. Females are red (rufescens) or violet (violacea) as immatures and, when mature, either mimic the blue colour of the males (androchrome), or acquire an inconspicuous olive-green (infuscans) or olive-brown (obsoleta). The genetic basis of these differences is still unknown. Here, we quantify the colour development of all morphs of I. elegans and investigate colour formation by combining anatomical data and reflectance spectra with optical finite-difference time-domain simulations. While the coloration primarily arises from a disordered assembly of nanospheres in the epidermis, morph-dependent changes result from adjustments in the composition of pterin pigments within the nanospheres, and from associated shifts in optical density. Other pigments fine-tune hue and brilliance by absorbing stray light. These mechanisms produce an impressive palette of colours and offer guidance for genetic studies on the evolution of colour polymorphism and visual communication.},

abstract = {The color of hair, skin, and eyes in animals mainly depends on the quantity, quality, and distribution of the pigment melanin, which occurs in two types: black to brown eumelanin and yellow to reddish pheomelanin. Microanalytical methods to quantify the amounts of eumelanin and pheomelanin in biological materials were developed in 1985. The methods are based on the chemical degradation of eumelanin to pyrrole-2,3,5-tricarboxylic acid and of pheomelanin to aminohydroxyphenylalanine isomers, which can be analyzed and quantitated by high performance liquid chromatography. This review summarizes and compares eumelanin and pheomelanin contents in various pigmented tissues obtained from humans, mice, and other animals. These methods have become valuable tools to study the functions of melanin, the control of melanogenesis, and the actions and interactions of pigmentation genes. The methods have also found applications in many clinical studies. High levels of pheomelanin are found only in yellow to red hairs of mammals and in red feathers of birds. It remains an intriguing question why lower vertebrates such as fishes do not synthesize pheomelanin. Detectable levels of pheomelanin are detected in human skin regardless of race, color, and skin type. However, eumelanin is always the major constituent of epidermal melanin, and the skin color appears to be determined by the quantity of melanin produced but not by the quality.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution. Xenarthra (armadillos, sloths, and anteaters) constitutes one of the four major clades of placental mammals. Despite their phylogenetic distinctiveness in mammals, a reference phylogeny is still lacking for the 31 described species. Here we used Illumina shotgun sequencing to assemble 33 new complete mitochondrial genomes, establishing Xenarthra as the first major placental clade to be fully sequenced at the species level for mitogenomes. The resulting data set allowed the reconstruction of a robust phylogenetic framework and timescale that are consistent with previous studies conducted at the genus level using nuclear genes. Incorporating the full species diversity of extant xenarthrans points to a number of inconsistencies in xenarthran systematics and species definition. We propose to split armadillos into two distinct families Dasypodidae (dasypodines) and Chlamyphoridae (euphractines, chlamyphorines, and tolypeutines) to better reflect their ancient divergence, estimated around 42 Ma. Species delimitation within long-nosed armadillos (genus Dasypus) appeared more complex than anticipated, with the discovery of a divergent lineage in French Guiana. Diversification analyses showed Xenarthra to be an ancient clade with a constant diversification rate through time with a species turnover driven by high but constant extinction. We also detected a significant negative correlation between speciation rate and past temperature fluctuations with an increase in speciation rate corresponding to the general cooling observed during the last 15 My. Biogeographic reconstructions identified the tropical rainforest biome of Amazonia and the Guiana Shield as the cradle of xenarthran evolutionary history with subsequent dispersions into more open and dry habitats.},

abstract = {Disk-winged bats (Thyroptera spp.) are the only mammals that use suction to cling to smooth surfaces, having evolved suction cups at the bases of the thumbs and feet that facilitate attachment to specialized roosts: the protective funnels of ephemeral furled leaves. We predicted that this combination of specialized morphology and roosting ecology is coupled with concomitantly specialized landing maneuvers. We tested this by investigating landings in Thyroptera tricolor using high-speed videography and a force-measuring landing pad disguised within a furled leaf analogue. We found that their landing maneuvers are distinct among all bats observed to date. Landings comprised three phases: (1) approach, (2) ballistic descent and (3) adhesion. During approach, bats adjusted trajectory until centered in front of and above the landing site, typically the leaf{\&}{\#}039;s protruding apex. Bats initiated ballistic descent by arresting the wingbeat cycle and tucking their wings to descend toward the leaf, simultaneously extending the thumb disks cranially. Adhesion commenced when the thumb disks contacted the landing site. Significant body reorientation occurred only during adhesion, and only after contact, when the thumb disks acted as fulcra about which the bats pitched 75.02±26.17 deg (mean±s.d.) to swing the foot disks into contact. Landings imposed 6.98±1.89 bodyweights of peak impact force. These landing mechanics are likely to be influenced by the orientation, spatial constraints and compliance of furled leaf roosts. Roosting ecology influences critical aspects of bat biology, and taken as a case study, this work suggests that roosting habits and landing mechanics could be functionally linked across bats.},

abstract = {The evolutionary origins of how modern humans share and use space are often modelled on the territorial-based violence of chimpanzees, with limited comparison to other apes. Gorillas are widely assumed to be non-territorial due to their large home ranges, extensive range overlap, and limited inter-group aggression. Using large-scale camera trapping, we monitored western gorillas in Republic of Congo across 60 km2. Avoidance patterns between groups were consistent with an understanding of the “ownership” of specific regions, with greater avoidance of their neighbours the closer they were to their neighbours' home range centres. Groups also avoided larger groups' home ranges to a greater extent, consistent with stronger defensive responses from more dominant groups. Our results suggest that groups may show territoriality, defending core regions of their home ranges against neighbours, and mirror patterns common across human evolution, with core areas of resident dominance and larger zones of mutual tolerance. This implies western gorillas may be a key system for understanding how humans have evolved the capacity for extreme territorial-based violence and warfare, whilst also engaging in the strong affiliative inter-group relationships necessary for large-scale cooperation.},

This study was designed to characterize growth and light requirements of six common neotropical tree species Pseudosamanea guachapele (Fabaceae), Tabebuia impetiginosa (Bignoniaceae), Ceiba pentandra (Bombacaceae), Pachira quinata (Bombacaceae), Dalbergia retusa (Fabaceae), and Tabebuia rosea (Bignoniaceae) in an abandoned pasture under contrasting light environments and grass competition. Field studies were conducted in the pastures of the Santa Ana Conservation Center in Costa Rica. Two differing grass competition sites were selected, one dominated by a tall grass, Hyparrhenia rufa and another dominated by a short grass, Cynodon mlenfluensis. Three light treatments were created (2, 37 and 100{\%} light) using either neutral shade cloth (2 and 37{\%}) or no shade cloth (100{\%}). Growth characteristics and biomass partitioning of the seedlings were measured. Species differed in their relative growth rates (RGRs). The light × species interaction was significant at both sites. While all species had similar performance under 100{\%} light on both short grass and tall grass sites, species growth differences were evident under 37 and 2{\%} light levels. For example, at the short grass site, T. rosea had higher RGR than D. retusa and P. quinata under 2{\%} light whereas both Tabebuia species performed better than other species at the tall grass site. The general trend was to increase root mass ratio and decrease leaf mass ratio with increasing levels of light. As an initial step for restoring abandoned pasture lands we recommend using all these species in direct and moderate light conditions. Incorporating all species will create a more heterogeneous environment. Choosing light demanding species that can tolerate grass competition may help ensure success in the early stage of restoration. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} American Museum of Natural History 2016.The ecological mechanisms that sustain high species richness in Neotropical bat communities have attracted research attention for several decades. Although many ecologists have studied the feeding behavior and diets of Neotropical bats on the assumption that food is a limiting resource, other resource axes that might be important for species coexistence are often ignored. Diurnal refugia, in particular, are a crucial resource for bats, many of which exhibit conspicuous morphological or behavioral adaptations to the roost environment. Here we report and analyze information about roost occupancy based on {\textgreater}500 field observations of Amazonian bats. Statistical analyses of these data suggest the existence of distinct groups of species roosting (1) in foliage, (2) exposed on the trunks of standing trees, (3) in cavities in standing trees, (4) in or under fallen trees, (5) beneath undercut earth banks, and (6) in arboreal insect nests; additionally, we recognize other groups that roost (7) in animal burrows, and (8) in rocks or caves. Roosting-guild membership is hypothesized to have a filtering effect on Amazonian bat community composition because some types of roosts are absent or uncommon in certain habitats. Among other applications of our results, cross-classifying bat species by trophic and roosting guilds suggests that the often-reported deficit of gleaning animalivores in secondary vegetation by comparison with primary forest might reflect habitat differences in roost availability rather than food resources. In general, ecological and evolutionary studies of Neotropical bats would be enhanced by considering both trophic- and roosting-guild membership in future analyses, but additional fieldwork will be required to determine the roosting behavior of many data-deficient species.

abstract = {Estimates of roosting habitat availability and population size using unbiased sampling regimes are completely lacking for any bat species. The use of conspicuous and accessible roosts in the developing, rolled leaves of Heliconia and Calathea plants by Thyroptera tricolor (Spix's disc-winged bat) provided an ideal opportunity to address this need. To assess roost availability and population size, the number of occupied and unoccupied leaves and bats in known areas in an area of lowland rain forest in north-eastern Costa Rica were quantified in 1998–99. A high density of leaves was available on any given day (mean: 43 leaves ha −1 ), but the density of roost leaves was low (mean: 2.5 leaves ha −1 ), corresponding with a low occupancy rate of 5.7 or 12{\%} based on different methods of estimation. Developing leaves were available for 8–16 h in the preferred size range of leaves used by T. tricolor , and a maximum of 28–60 h, depending on the plant species. Using closed-population mark–recapture models, the 5.69-ha study area supported 261 individuals over a 4-mo period in 1998, corresponding to a density of 43 bats ha −1 . These results have important implications for the results of studies on bat community structure and rarity, and for the behaviour and ecology of T. tricolor .},
